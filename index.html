        58 Endnotes 67 Editorial Introduction The “Manifesto of the Communist
        Party” was written by Marx and Engels as the Communist League’s
        programme on the instruction of its Second Congress (London, November
        29-December 8, 1847), which signified a victory for the followers of a
        new proletarian line during the discussion of the programme questions.
        When Congress was still in preparation, Marx and Engels arrived at the
        conclusion that the final programme document should be in the form of a
        Party manifesto (see Engels’ letter to Marx of November 23-24, 1847).
        The catechism form usual for the secret societies of the time and
        retained in the “Draft of a Communist Confession of Faith” and
        “Principles of Communism,” was not suitable for a full and substantial
        exposition of the new revolutionary world outlook, for a comprehensive
        formulation of the proletarian movement’s aims and tasks. See also
        “Demands of the Communist Party in Germany,” issued by Marx soon after
        publication of the Manifesto, which addressed the immediate demands of
        the movement. Marx and Engels began working together on the Manifesto
        while they were still in London immediately after the congress, and
        continued until about December 13 when Marx returned to Brussels; they
        resumed their work four days later (December 17) when Engels arrived
        there. After Engels’ departure for Paris at the end of December and up
        to his return on January 31, Marx worked on the Manifesto alone. Hurried
        by the Central Authority of the Communist League which provided him with
        certain documents (e.g., addresses of the People’s Chamber (Halle) of
        the League of the Just of November 1846 and February 1847, and,
        apparently, documents of the First Congress of the Communist League
        pertaining to the discussion of the Party programme), Marx worked
        intensively on the Manifesto through almost the whole of January 1848.
        At the end of January the manuscript was sent on to London to be printed
        in the German Workers’ Educational Society’s print shop owned by a
        German emigrant J. E. Burghard, a member of the Communist League. The
        manuscript of the Manifesto has not survived. The only extant materials
        written in Marx’s hand are a draft plan for Section III, showing his
        efforts to improve the structure of the Manifesto, and a page of a rough
        copy. The Manifesto came off the press at the end of February 1848. On
        February 29, the Educational Society decided to cover all the printing
        expenses. The first edition of the Manifesto was a 23-page pamphlet in a
        dark green cover. In April-May 1848 another edition was put out. The
        text took up 30 pages, some misprints of the first edition were
        corrected, and the punctuation improved. Subsequently this text was used
        by Marx and Engels as a basis for later authorised editions. Between
        March and July 1848 the Manifesto was printed in the Deutsche Londoner
        Zeitung, a democratic newspaper of the German emigrants. Already that
        same year numerous efforts were made to publish the Manifesto in other
        European languages. A Danish, a Polish (in Paris) and a Swedish (under a
        different title: “The Voice of Communism. Declaration of the Communist
        Party”) editions appeared in 1848. The translations into French, Italian
        and Spanish made at that time remained unpublished. In April 1848,
        Engels, then in Barmen, was translating the Manifesto into English, but
        he managed to translate only half of it, and the first English
        translation, made by Helen Macfarlane, was not published until two years
        later, between June and November 1850, in the Chartist journal The Red
        Republican. Its editor, Julian Harney, named the authors for the first
        time in the introduction to this publication. All earlier and many
        subsequent editions of the Manifesto were anonymous. The growing
        emancipation struggle of the proletariat in the ’60s and ’70s of the
        19th century led to new editions of the Manifesto. The year 1872 saw a
        new German edition with minor corrections and a preface by Marx and
        Engels where they drew some conclusions from the experience of the Paris
        Commune of 1871. This and subsequent German editions (1883 and 1890)
        were entitled the Communist Manifesto. In 1872 the Manifesto was first
        published in America in Woodhull & Claflin’s Weekly. The first Russian
        edition of the Manifesto, translated by Mikhail Bakunin with some
        distortions, appeared in Geneva in 1869. The faults of this edition were
        removed in the 1882 edition (translation by Georgi Plekhanov), for which
        Marx and Engels, who attributed great significance to the dissemination
        of Marxism in Russia, had written a special preface. After Marx’s death,
        the Manifesto ran into several editions. Engels read through them all,
        wrote prefaces for the 1883 German edition and for the 1888 English
        edition in Samuel Moore’s translation, which he also edited and supplied
        with notes. This edition served as a basis for many subsequent editions
        of the Manifesto in English – in Britain, the United States and the
        USSR. In 1890, Engels prepared a further German edition, wrote a new
        preface to it, and added a number of notes. In 1885, the newspaper Le
        Socialiste published the French translation of the Manifesto made by
        Marx’s daughter Laura Lafargue and read by Engels. He also wrote
        prefaces to the 1892 Polish and 1893 Italian editions. This edition
        includes the two earlier versions of the Manifesto, namely the draft
        “Communist Confession of Faith” and “The Principles of Communism,” both
        authored by Engels, as well as the letter from Engels to Marx which
        poses the idea of publishing a “manifesto,” rather than a catechism. The
        Manifesto addressed itself to a mass movement with historical
        significance, not a political sect. On the other hand, the “Demands of
        the Communist Party in Germany” is included to place the publication of
        the Manifesto in the context of the mass movement in Germany at the
        time, whose immediate demands are reflected by Marx in this pamphlet.
        Clearly the aims of the Manifesto were more far-reaching the movement in
        Germany at the time, and unlike the “Demands,” was intended to outlive
        the immediate conditions. The “Third Address to the International
        Workingmen’s Association” is included because in this speech Marx
        examines the movement of the working class manifested in the Paris
        Commune, and his observations here mark the only revisions to his social
        and historical vision made during his lifetime as a result of the
        development of the working class movement itself, clarifying some points
        and making others more concrete. Preface to The 1872 German Edition The
        Communist League, an international association of workers, which could
        of course be only a secret one, under conditions obtaining at the time,
        commissioned us, the undersigned, at the Congress held in London in
        November 1847, to write for publication a detailed theoretical and
        practical programme for the Party. Such was the origin of the following
        Manifesto, the manuscript of which travelled to London to be printed a
        few weeks before the February [French] Revolution [in 1848].
