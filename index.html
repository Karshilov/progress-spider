        58 Endnotes 67 Editorial Introduction The “Manifesto of the Communist
        Party” was written by Marx and Engels as the Communist League’s
        programme on the instruction of its Second Congress (London, November
        29-December 8, 1847), which signified a victory for the followers of a
        new proletarian line during the discussion of the programme questions.
        When Congress was still in preparation, Marx and Engels arrived at the
        conclusion that the final programme document should be in the form of a
        Party manifesto (see Engels’ letter to Marx of November 23-24, 1847).
        The catechism form usual for the secret societies of the time and
        retained in the “Draft of a Communist Confession of Faith” and
        “Principles of Communism,” was not suitable for a full and substantial
        exposition of the new revolutionary world outlook, for a comprehensive
        formulation of the proletarian movement’s aims and tasks. See also
        “Demands of the Communist Party in Germany,” issued by Marx soon after
        publication of the Manifesto, which addressed the immediate demands of
        the movement. Marx and Engels began working together on the Manifesto
        while they were still in London immediately after the congress, and
        continued until about December 13 when Marx returned to Brussels; they
        resumed their work four days later (December 17) when Engels arrived
        there. After Engels’ departure for Paris at the end of December and up
        to his return on January 31, Marx worked on the Manifesto alone. Hurried
        by the Central Authority of the Communist League which provided him with
        certain documents (e.g., addresses of the People’s Chamber (Halle) of
        the League of the Just of November 1846 and February 1847, and,
        apparently, documents of the First Congress of the Communist League
        pertaining to the discussion of the Party programme), Marx worked
        intensively on the Manifesto through almost the whole of January 1848.
        At the end of January the manuscript was sent on to London to be printed
        in the German Workers’ Educational Society’s print shop owned by a
        German emigrant J. E. Burghard, a member of the Communist League. The
        manuscript of the Manifesto has not survived. The only extant materials
        written in Marx’s hand are a draft plan for Section III, showing his
        efforts to improve the structure of the Manifesto, and a page of a rough
        copy. The Manifesto came off the press at the end of February 1848. On
        February 29, the Educational Society decided to cover all the printing
        expenses. The first edition of the Manifesto was a 23-page pamphlet in a
        dark green cover. In April-May 1848 another edition was put out. The
        text took up 30 pages, some misprints of the first edition were
        corrected, and the punctuation improved. Subsequently this text was used
        by Marx and Engels as a basis for later authorised editions. Between
        March and July 1848 the Manifesto was printed in the Deutsche Londoner
        Zeitung, a democratic newspaper of the German emigrants. Already that
        same year numerous efforts were made to publish the Manifesto in other
        European languages. A Danish, a Polish (in Paris) and a Swedish (under a
        different title: “The Voice of Communism. Declaration of the Communist
        Party”) editions appeared in 1848. The translations into French, Italian
        and Spanish made at that time remained unpublished. In April 1848,
        Engels, then in Barmen, was translating the Manifesto into English, but
        he managed to translate only half of it, and the first English
        translation, made by Helen Macfarlane, was not published until two years
        later, between June and November 1850, in the Chartist journal The Red
        Republican. Its editor, Julian Harney, named the authors for the first
        time in the introduction to this publication. All earlier and many
        subsequent editions of the Manifesto were anonymous. The growing
        emancipation struggle of the proletariat in the ’60s and ’70s of the
        19th century led to new editions of the Manifesto. The year 1872 saw a
        new German edition with minor corrections and a preface by Marx and
        Engels where they drew some conclusions from the experience of the Paris
        Commune of 1871. This and subsequent German editions (1883 and 1890)
        were entitled the Communist Manifesto. In 1872 the Manifesto was first
        published in America in Woodhull & Claflin’s Weekly. The first Russian
        edition of the Manifesto, translated by Mikhail Bakunin with some
        distortions, appeared in Geneva in 1869. The faults of this edition were
        removed in the 1882 edition (translation by Georgi Plekhanov), for which
        Marx and Engels, who attributed great significance to the dissemination
        of Marxism in Russia, had written a special preface. After Marx’s death,
        the Manifesto ran into several editions. Engels read through them all,
        wrote prefaces for the 1883 German edition and for the 1888 English
        edition in Samuel Moore’s translation, which he also edited and supplied
        with notes. This edition served as a basis for many subsequent editions
        of the Manifesto in English – in Britain, the United States and the
        USSR. In 1890, Engels prepared a further German edition, wrote a new
        preface to it, and added a number of notes. In 1885, the newspaper Le
        Socialiste published the French translation of the Manifesto made by
        Marx’s daughter Laura Lafargue and read by Engels. He also wrote
        prefaces to the 1892 Polish and 1893 Italian editions. This edition
        includes the two earlier versions of the Manifesto, namely the draft
        “Communist Confession of Faith” and “The Principles of Communism,” both
        authored by Engels, as well as the letter from Engels to Marx which
        poses the idea of publishing a “manifesto,” rather than a catechism. The
        Manifesto addressed itself to a mass movement with historical
        significance, not a political sect. On the other hand, the “Demands of
        the Communist Party in Germany” is included to place the publication of
        the Manifesto in the context of the mass movement in Germany at the
        time, whose immediate demands are reflected by Marx in this pamphlet.
        Clearly the aims of the Manifesto were more far-reaching the movement in
        Germany at the time, and unlike the “Demands,” was intended to outlive
        the immediate conditions. The “Third Address to the International
        Workingmen’s Association” is included because in this speech Marx
        examines the movement of the working class manifested in the Paris
        Commune, and his observations here mark the only revisions to his social
        and historical vision made during his lifetime as a result of the
        development of the working class movement itself, clarifying some points
        and making others more concrete. Preface to The 1872 German Edition The
        Communist League, an international association of workers, which could
        of course be only a secret one, under conditions obtaining at the time,
        commissioned us, the undersigned, at the Congress held in London in
        November 1847, to write for publication a detailed theoretical and
        practical programme for the Party. Such was the origin of the following
        Manifesto, the manuscript of which travelled to London to be printed a
        few weeks before the February [French] Revolution [in 1848]. First
        published in German, it has been republished in that language in at
        least twelve different editions in Germany, England, and America. It was
        published in English for the first time in 1850 in the Red Republican,
        London, translated by Miss Helen Macfarlane, and in 1871 in at least
        three different translations in America. The French version first
        appeared in Paris shortly before the June insurrection of 1848, and
        recently in Le Socialiste of New York. A new translation is in the
        course of preparation. A Polish version appeared in London shortly after
        it was first published in Germany. A Russian translation was published
        in Geneva in the sixties[ The first Russian translation of the Manifesto
        of the Communist Party was made by Bakunin, who despite being one of
        Marx and Engels’ most pronounced opponents in the working class
        movement, saw the great revolutionary importance contained within the
        Manifesto. Published in Geneva in 1869 (printing it in Russia was
        impossible due to state censorship), Bakunin’ s translation was not
        completely accurate, and was replaced a decade later by Plekhanov’s
        translation in 1882, for which both Marx and Engels wrote a preface. ].
        Into Danish, too, it was translated shortly after its appearance.
        However much that state of things may have altered during the last
        twenty-five years, the general principles laid down in the Manifesto
        are, on the whole, as correct today as ever. Here and there, some detail
        might be improved. The practical application of the principles will
        depend, as the Manifesto itself states, everywhere and at all times, on
        the historical conditions for the time being existing, and, for that
        reason, no special stress is laid on the revolutionary measures proposed
        at the end of Section II. That passage would, in many respects, be very
        differently worded today. In view of the gigantic strides of Modern
        Industry since 1848, and of the accompanying improved and extended
        organization of the working class, in view of the practical experience
        gained, first in the February Revolution, and then, still more, in the
        Paris Commune, where the proletariat for the first time held political
        power for two whole months, this programme has in some details been
        antiquated. One thing especially was proved by the Commune, viz., that
        “the working class cannot simply lay hold of the ready-made state
        machinery, and wield it for its own purposes.” (See The Civil War in
        France: Address of the General Council of the International Working
        Men’s Association, 1871, where this point is further developed.)
        Further, it is self-evident that the criticism of socialist literature
        is deficient in relation to the present time, because it comes down only
        to 1847; also that the remarks on the relation of the Communists to the
        various opposition parties (Section IV), although, in principle still
        correct, yet in practice are antiquated, because the political situation
        has been entirely changed, and the progress of history has swept from
        off the earth the greater portion of the political parties there
        enumerated. But then, the Manifesto has become a historical document
        which we have no longer any right to alter. A subsequent edition may
        perhaps appear with an introduction bridging the gap from 1847 to the
        present day; but this reprint was too unexpected to leave us time for
        that. Karl Marx & Frederick Engels June 24, 1872, London Preface to The
        1882 Russian Edition The first Russian edition of the Manifesto of the
        Communist Party, translated by Bakunin, was published early in the
        ‘sixties by the printing office of the Kolokol [a reference to the Free
        Russian Printing House]. Then the West could see in it (the Russian
        edition of the Manifesto) only a literary curiosity. Such a view would
        be impossible today. What a limited field the proletarian movement
        occupied at that time (December 1847) is most clearly shown by the last
        section: the position of the Communists in relation to the various
        opposition parties in various countries. Precisely Russia and the United
        States are missing here. It was the time when Russia constituted the
        last great reserve of all European reaction, when the United States
        absorbed the surplus proletarian forces of Europe through immigration.
        Both countries provided Europe with raw materials and were at the same
        time markets for the sale of its industrial products. Both were,
        therefore, in one way of another, pillars of the existing European
        system. How very different today. Precisely European immigration fitted
        North American for a gigantic agricultural production, whose competition
        is shaking the very foundations of European landed property – large and
        small. At the same time, it enabled the United States to exploit its
        tremendous industrial resources with an energy and on a scale that must
        shortly break the industrial monopoly of Western Europe, and especially
        of England, existing up to now. Both circumstances react in a
        revolutionary manner upon America itself. Step by step, the small and
        middle land ownership of the farmers, the basis of the whole political
        constitution, is succumbing to the competition of giant farms; at the
        same time, a mass industrial proletariat and a fabulous concentration of
        capital funds are developing for the first time in the industrial
        regions. And now Russia! During the Revolution of 1848-9, not only the
        European princes, but the European bourgeois as well, found their only
        salvation from the proletariat just beginning to awaken in Russian
        intervention. The Tsar was proclaimed the chief of European reaction.
        Today, he is a prisoner of war of the revolution in Gatchina[ A
        reference to the events that occurred in Russia after the assassination,
        on March, 1, 1881, of Emperor Alexander II by Narodnaya Volya members.
        Alexander III, his successor, was staying in Gatchina for fear of
        further terrorism. ], and Russia forms the vanguard of revolutionary
        action in Europe. The Communist Manifesto had, as its object, the
        proclamation of the inevitable impending dissolution of modern bourgeois
        property. But in Russia we find, face-to-face with the rapidly flowering
        capitalist swindle and bourgeois property, just beginning to develop,
        more than half the land owned in common by the peasants. Now the
        question is: can the Russian obshchina, though greatly undermined, yet a
        form of primeval common ownership of land, pass directly to the higher
        form of Communist common ownership? Or, on the contrary, must it first
        pass through the same process of dissolution such as constitutes the
        historical evolution of the West? The only answer to that possible today
        is this: If the Russian Revolution becomes the signal for a proletarian
        revolution in the West, so that both complement each other, the present
        Russian common ownership of land may serve as the starting point for a
        communist development. Karl Marx & Frederick Engels January 21, 1882,
        London Preface to The 1883 German Edition The preface to the present
        edition I must, alas, sign alone. Marx, the man to whom the whole
        working class of Europe and America owes more than to any one else –
        rests at Highgate Cemetery and over his grave the first grass is already
        growing. Since his death [March 14, 1883], there can be even less
        thought of revising or supplementing the Manifesto. But I consider it
        all the more necessary again to state the following expressly: The basic
        thought running through the Manifesto – that economic production, and
        the structure of society of every historical epoch necessarily arising
        therefrom, constitute the foundation for the political and intellectual
        history of that epoch; that consequently (ever since the dissolution of
        the primaeval communal ownership of land) all history has been a history
        of class struggles, of struggles between exploited and exploiting,
        between dominated and dominating classes at various stages of social
        evolution; that this struggle, however, has now reached a stage where
        the exploited and oppressed class (the proletariat) can no longer
        emancipate itself from the class which exploits and oppresses it (the
        bourgeoisie), without at the same time forever freeing the whole of
        society from exploitation, oppression, class struggles – this basic
        thought belongs solely and exclusively to Marx.[* “This proposition,” I
        wrote in the preface to the English translation, “which, in my opinion,
        is destined to do for history what Darwin’ s theory has done for
        biology, we both of us, had been gradually approaching for some years
        before 1845. How far I had independently progressed towards it is best
        shown by my Conditions of the Working Class in England. But when I again
        met Marx at Brussels, in spring 1845, he had it already worked out and
        put it before me in terms almost as clear as those in which I have
        stated it here.” [Note by Engels to the German edition of 1890] ]* I
        have already stated this many times; but precisely now is it necessary
        that it also stand in front of the Manifesto itself. Frederick Engels
        June 28, 1883, London Preface to The 1888 English Edition The Manifesto
        was published as the platform of the Communist League, a working men’ s
        association, first exclusively German, later on international, and under
        the political conditions of the Continent before 1848, unavoidably a
        secret society. At a Congress of the League, held in November 1847, Marx
        and Engels were commissioned to prepare a complete theoretical and
        practical party programme. Drawn up in German, in January 1848, the
        manuscript was sent to the printer in London a few weeks before the
        French Revolution of February 24. A French translation was brought out
        in Paris shortly before the insurrection of June 1848. The first English
        translation, by Miss Helen Macfarlane, appeared in George Julian Harney’
        s Red Republican, London, 1850. A Danish and a Polish edition had also
        been published. The defeat of the Parisian insurrection of June 1848 –
        the first great battle between proletariat and bourgeoisie – drove again
        into the background, for a time, the social and political aspirations of
        the European working class. Thenceforth, the struggle for supremacy was,
        again, as it had been before the Revolution of February, solely between
        different sections of the propertied class; the working class was
        reduced to a fight for political elbow-room, and to the position of
        extreme wing of the middle-class Radicals. Wherever independent
        proletarian movements continued to show signs of life, they were
        ruthlessly hunted down. Thus the Prussian police hunted out the Central
        Board of the Communist League, then located in Cologne. The members were
        arrested and, after eighteen months’ imprisonment, they were tried in
        October 1852. This celebrated “Cologne Communist Trial” lasted from
        October 4 till November 12; seven of the prisoners were sentenced to
        terms of imprisonment in a fortress, varying from three to six years.
        Immediately after the sentence, the League was formally dissolved by the
        remaining members. As to the Manifesto, it seemed henceforth doomed to
        oblivion. When the European workers had recovered sufficient strength
        for another attack on the ruling classes, the International Working Men’
        s Association sprang up. But this association, formed with the express
        aim of welding into one body the whole militant proletariat of Europe
        and America, could not at once proclaim the principles laid down in the
        Manifesto. The International was bound to have a programme broad enough
        to be acceptable to the English trade unions, to the followers of
        Proudhon in France, Belgium, Italy, and Spain, and to the Lassalleans in
        Germany.[* Lassalle personally, to us, always acknowledged himself to be
        a disciple of Marx, and, as such, stood on the ground of the Manifesto.
        But in his first public agitation, 1862-1864, he did not go beyond
        demanding co-operative workshops supported by state credit. ]* Marx, who
        drew up this programme to the satisfaction of all parties, entirely
        trusted to the intellectual development of the working class, which was
        sure to result from combined action and mutual discussion. The very
        events and vicissitudes in the struggle against capital, the defeats
        even more than the victories, could not help bringing home to men’ s
        minds the insufficiency of their various favorite nostrums, and
        preparing the way for a more complete insight into the true conditions
        for working-class emancipation. And Marx was right. The International,
        on its breaking in 1874, left the workers quite different men from what
        it found them in 1864. Proudhonism in France, Lassalleanism in Germany,
        were dying out, and even the conservative English trade unions, though
        most of them had long since severed their connection with the
        International, were gradually advancing towards that point at which,
        last year at Swansea, their president [W. Bevan] could say in their
        name: “Continental socialism has lost its terror for us.” In fact, the
        principles of the Manifesto had made considerable headway among the
        working men of all countries. The Manifesto itself came thus to the
        front again. Since 1850, the German text had been reprinted several
        times in Switzerland, England, and America. In 1872, it was translated
        into English in New York, where the translation was published in
        Woorhull and Claflin’s Weekly. From this English version, a French one
        was made in Le Socialiste of New York. Since then, at least two more
        English translations, more or less mutilated, have been brought out in
        America, and one of them has been reprinted in England. The first
        Russian translation, made by Bakunin, was published at Herzen’ s Kolokol
        office in Geneva, about 1863; a second one, by the heroic Vera Zasulich,
        also in Geneva, in 1882. A new Danish edition is to be found in
        Socialdemokratisk Bibliothek, Copenhagen, 1885; a fresh French
        translation in Le Socialiste, Paris, 1886. From this latter, a Spanish
        version was prepared and published in Madrid, 1886. The German reprints
        are not to be counted; there have been twelve altogether at the least.
        An Armenian translation, which was to be published in Constantinople
        some months ago, did not see the light, I am told, because the publisher
        was afraid of bringing out a book with the name of Marx on it, while the
        translator declined to call it his own production. Of further
        translations into other languages I have heard but had not seen. Thus
        the history of the Manifesto reflects the history of the modern
        working-class movement; at present, it is doubtless the most wide
        spread, the most international production of all socialist literature,
        the common platform acknowledged by millions of working men from Siberia
        to California. Yet, when it was written, we could not have called it a
        socialist manifesto. By Socialists, in 1847, were understood, on the one
        hand the adherents of the various Utopian systems: Owenites in England,
        Fourierists in France, both of them already reduced to the position of
        mere sects, and gradually dying out; on the other hand, the most
        multifarious social quacks who, by all manner of tinkering, professed to
        redress, without any danger to capital and profit, all sorts of social
        grievances, in both cases men outside the working-class movement, and
        looking rather to the “educated” classes for support. Whatever portion
        of the working class had become convinced of the insufficiency of mere
        political revolutions, and had proclaimed the necessity of total social
        change, called itself Communist. It was a crude, rough-hewn, purely
        instinctive sort of communism; still, it touched the cardinal point and
        was powerful enough amongst the working class to produce the Utopian
        communism of Cabet in France, and of Weitling in Germany. Thus, in 1847,
        socialism was a middle-class movement, communism a working-class
        movement. Socialism was, on the Continent at least, “respectable”;
        communism was the very opposite. And as our notion, from the very
        beginning, was that “the emancipation of the workers must be the act of
        the working class itself,” there could be no doubt as to which of the
        two names we must take. Moreover, we have, ever since, been far from
        repudiating it. The Manifesto being our joint production, I consider
        myself bound to state that the fundamental proposition which forms the
        nucleus belongs to Marx. That proposition is: That in every historical
        epoch, the prevailing mode of economic production and exchange, and the
        social organization necessarily following from it, form the basis upon
        which it is built up, and from that which alone can be explained the
        political and intellectual history of that epoch; that consequently the
        whole history of mankind (since the dissolution of primitive tribal
        society, holding land in common ownership) has been a history of class
        struggles, contests between exploiting and exploited, ruling and
        oppressed classes; That the history of these class struggles forms a
        series of evolutions in which, nowadays, a stage has been reached where
        the exploited and oppressed class – the proletariat – cannot attain its
        emancipation from the sway of the exploiting and ruling class – the
        bourgeoisie – without, at the same time, and once and for all,
        emancipating society at large from all exploitation, oppression, class
        distinction, and class struggles. This proposition, which, in my
        opinion, is destined to do for history what Darwin’ s theory has done
        for biology, we both of us, had been gradually approaching for some
        years before 1845. How far I had independently progressed towards it is
        best shown by my “Conditions of the Working Class in England.” But when
        I again met Marx at Brussels, in spring 1845, he had it already worked
        out and put it before me in terms almost as clear as those in which I
        have stated it here. From our joint preface to the German edition of
        1872, I quote the following: “However much that state of things may have
        altered during the last twenty-five years, the general principles laid
        down in the Manifesto are, on the whole, as correct today as ever. Here
        and there, some detail might be improved. The practical application of
        the principles will depend, as the Manifesto itself states, everywhere
        and at all times, on the historical conditions for the time being
        existing, and, for that reason, no special stress is laid on the
        revolutionary measures proposed at the end of Section II. That passage
        would, in many respects, be very differently worded today. In view of
        the gigantic strides of Modern Industry since 1848, and of the
        accompanying improved and extended organization of the working class, in
        view of the practical experience gained, first in the February
        Revolution, and then, still more, in the Paris Commune, where the
        proletariat for the first time held political power for two whole
        months, this programme has in some details been antiquated. One thing
        especially was proved by the Commune, viz., that “the working class
        cannot simply lay hold of ready-made state machinery, and wield it for
        its own purposes.” (See The Civil War in France: Address of the General
        Council of the International Working Men’ s Association 1871, where this
        point is further developed.) Further, it is self-evident that the
        criticism of socialist literature is deficient in relation to the
        present time, because it comes down only to 1847; also that the remarks
        on the relation of the Communists to the various opposition parties
        (Section IV), although, in principle still correct, yet in practice are
        antiquated, because the political situation has been entirely changed,
        and the progress of history has swept from off the Earth the greater
        portion of the political parties there enumerated. “But then, the
        Manifesto has become a historical document which we have no longer any
        right to alter.” The present translation is by Mr Samuel Moore, the
        translator of the greater portion of Marx’ s “Capital.” We have revised
        it in common, and I have added a few notes explanatory of historical
        allusions. Frederick Engels January 30, 1888, London Preface to The 1890
        German Edition Since [the first German preface of 1883] was written, a
        new German edition of the Manifesto has again become necessary, and much
        has also happened to the Manifesto which should be recorded here. A
        second Russian translation – by Vera Zasulich – appeared in Geneva in
        1882; the preface to that edition was written by Marx and myself.
        Unfortunately, the original German manuscript has gone astray; I must
        therefore retranslate from the Russian which will in no way improve the
        text. It reads: [Reprint of the 1882 Russian Edition ] At about the same
        date, a new Polish version appeared in Geneva: Manifest Kommunistyczny.
        Furthermore, a new Danish translation has appeared in the
        Socialdemokratisk Bibliothek, Copenhagen, 1885. Unfortunately, it is not
        quite complete; certain essential passages, which seem to have presented
        difficulties to the translator, have been omitted, and, in addition,
        there are signs of carelessness here and there, which are all the more
        unpleasantly conspicuous since the translation indicates that had the
        translator taken a little more pains, he would have done an excellent
        piece of work. A new French version appeared in 1886, in Le Socialiste
        of Paris; it is the best published to date. From this latter, a Spanish
        version was published the same year in El Socialista of Madrid, and then
        reissued in pamphlet form: Manifesto del Partido Communista por Carlos
        Marx y F. Engels, Madrid, Administracion de El Socialista, Hernan Cortes
        8. As a matter of curiosity, I may mention that in 1887 the manuscript
        of an Armenian translation was offered to a publisher in Constantinople.
        But the good man did not have the courage to publish something bearing
        the name of Marx and suggested that the translator set down his own name
        as author, which the latter however declined. After one, and then
        another, of the more or less inaccurate American translations had been
        repeatedly reprinted in England, an authentic version at last appeared
        in 1888. This was my friend Samuel Moore, and we went through it
        together once more before it went to press. It is entitled: Manifesto of
        the Communist Party, by Karl Marx and Frederick Engels. Authorized
        English translation, edited and annotated by Frederick Engels, 1888,
        London, William Reeves, 185 Fleet Street, E.C. I have added some of the
        notes of that edition to the present one. The Manifesto has had a
        history of its own. Greeted with enthusiasm, at the time of its
        appearance, by the not at all numerous vanguard of scientific socialism
        (as is proved by the translations mentioned in the first place), it was
        soon forced into the background by the reaction that began with the
        defeat of the Paris workers in June 1848, and was finally excommunicated
        “by law” in the conviction of the Cologne Communists in November 1852.
        With the disappearance from the public scene of the workers’ movement
        that had begun with the February Revolution, the Manifesto too passed
        into the background. When the European workers had again gathered
        sufficient strength for a new onslaught upon the power of the ruling
        classes, the International Working Men’ s Association came into being.
        Its aim was to weld together into one huge army the whole militant
        working class of Europe and America. Therefore it could not set out from
        the principles laid down in the Manifesto. It was bound to have a
        programme which would not shut the door on the English trade unions, the
        French, Belgian, Italian, and Spanish Proudhonists, and the German
        Lassalleans. This programme – the considerations underlying the Statutes
        of the International – was drawn up by Marx with a master hand
        acknowledged even by the Bakunin and the anarchists. For the ultimate
        final triumph of the ideas set forth in the Manifesto, Marx relied
        solely upon the intellectual development of the working class, as it
        necessarily has to ensue from united action and discussion. The events
        and vicissitudes in the struggle against capital, the defeats even more
        than the successes, could not but demonstrate to the fighters the
        inadequacy of their former universal panaceas, and make their minds more
        receptive to a thorough understanding of the true conditions for
        working-class emancipation. And Marx was right. The working class of
        1874, at the dissolution of the International, was altogether different
        from that of 1864, at its foundation. Proudhonism in the Latin
        countries, and the specific Lassalleanism in Germany, were dying out;
        and even the ten arch-conservative English trade unions were gradually
        approaching the point where, in 1887, the chairman of their Swansea
        Congress could say in their name: “Continental socialism has lost its
        terror for us.” Yet by 1887 continental socialism was almost exclusively
        the theory heralded in the Manifesto. Thus, to a certain extent, the
        history of the Manifesto reflects the history of the modern
        working-class movement since 1848. At present, it is doubtless the most
        widely circulated, the most international product of all socialist
        literature, the common programme of many millions of workers of all
        countries from Siberia to California. Nevertheless, when it appeared, we
        could not have called it a socialist manifesto. In 1847, two kinds of
        people were considered socialists. On the one hand were the adherents of
        the various utopian systems, notably the Owenites in England and the
        Fourierists in France, both of whom, at that date, had already dwindled
        to mere sects gradually dying out. On the other, the manifold types of
        social quacks who wanted to eliminate social abuses through their
        various universal panaceas and all kinds of patch-work, without hurting
        capital and profit in the least. In both cases, people who stood outside
        the labor movement and who looked for support rather to the “educated”
        classes. The section of the working class, however, which demanded a
        radical reconstruction of society, convinced that mere political
        revolutions were not enough, then called itself Communist. It was still
        a rough-hewn, only instinctive and frequently somewhat crude communism.
        Yet, it was powerful enough to bring into being two systems of utopian
        communism – in France, the “Icarian” communists of Cabet, and in Germany
        that of Weitling. Socialism in 1847 signified a bourgeois movement,
        communism a working-class movement. Socialism was, on the Continent at
        least, quite respectable, whereas communism was the very opposite. And
        since we were very decidedly of the opinion as early as then that “the
        emancipation of the workers must be the task of the working class
        itself,” [from the General Rules of the International] we could have no
        hesitation as to which of the two names we should choose. Nor has it
        ever occurred to us to repudiate it. “Working men of all countries,
        unite!” But few voices responded when we proclaimed these words to the
        world 42 years ago, on the eve of the first Paris Revolution in which
        the proletariat came out with the demands of its own. On September 28,
        1864, however, the proletarians of most of the Western European
        countries joined hands in the International Working Men’ s Association
        of glorious memory. True, the International itself lived only nine
        years. But that the eternal union of the proletarians of all countries
        created by it is still alive and lives stronger than ever, there is no
        better witness than this day. Because today[ This preface was written by
        Engels on May 1, 1890, when, in accordance with the decision of the
        Paris Congress of the Second International (July 1889), mass
        demonstrations, strikes and meetings were held in numerous European and
        American countries. The workers put forward the demand for an 8 hour
        working day and other demands set forth by the Congress. From that day
        forward workers all over the world celebrate the first of May as a day
        of international proletarian solidarity. ], as I write these lines, the
        European and American proletariat is reviewing its fighting forces,
        mobilized for the first time, mobilized as one army, under one flag, for
        one immediate aim: the standard eight-hour working day to be established
        by legal enactment, as proclaimed by the Geneva Congress of the
        International in 1866, and again by the Paris Workers’ Congress of 1889.
        And today’ s spectacle will open the eyes of the capitalists and
        landlords of all countries to the fact that today the proletarians of
        all countries are united indeed. If only Marx were still by my side to
        see this with his own eyes! Frederick Engels May 1, 1890, London Preface
        to The 1892 Polish Edition The fact that a new Polish edition of the
        Communist Manifesto has become necessary gives rise to various thoughts.
        First of all, it is noteworthy that of late the Manifesto has become an
        index, as it were, of the development of large-scale industry on the
        European continent. In proportion as large-scale industry expands in a
        given country, the demand grows among the workers of that country for
        enlightenment regarding their position as the working class in relation
        to the possessing classes, the socialist movement spreads among them and
        the demand for the Manifesto increases. Thus, not only the state of the
        labour movement but also the degree of development of large-scale
        industry can be measured with fair accuracy in every country by the
        number of copies of the Manifesto circulated in the language of that
        country. Accordingly, the new Polish edition indicates a decided
        progress of Polish industry. And there can be no doubt whatever that
        this progress since the previous edition published ten years ago has
        actually taken place. Russian Poland, Congress Poland, has become the
        big industrial region of the Russian Empire. Whereas Russian large-scale
        industry is scattered sporadically – a part round the Gulf of Finland,
        another in the centre (Moscow and Vladimir), a third along the coasts of
        the Black and Azov seas, and still others elsewhere – Polish industry
        has been packed into a relatively small area and enjoys both the
        advantages and disadvantages arising from such concentration. The
        competing Russian manufacturers acknowledged the advantages when they
        demanded protective tariffs against Poland, in spit of their ardent
        desire to transform the Poles into Russians. The disadvantages – for the
        Polish manufacturers and the Russian government – are manifest in the
        rapid spread of socialist ideas among the Polish workers and in the
        growing demand for the Manifesto. But the rapid development of Polish
        industry, outstripping that of Russia, is in its turn a new proof of the
        inexhaustible vitality of the Polish people and a new guarantee of its
        impending national restoration. And the restoration of an independent
        and strong Poland is a matter which concerns not only the Poles but all
        of us. A sincere international collaboration of the European nations is
        possible only if each of these nations is fully autonomous in its own
        house. The Revolution of 1848, which under the banner of the
        proletariat, after all, merely let the proletarian fighters do the work
        of the bourgeoisie, also secured the independence of Italy, Germany and
        Hungary through its testamentary executors, Louis Bonaparte and
        Bismarck; but Poland, which since 1792 had done more for the Revolution
        than all these three together, was left to its own resources when it
        succumbed in 1863 to a tenfold greater Russian force. The nobility could
        neither maintain nor regain Polish independence; today, to the
        bourgeoisie, this independence is, to say the last, immaterial.
        Nevertheless, it is a necessity for the harmonious collaboration of the
        European nations. It can be gained only by the young Polish proletariat,
        and in its hands it is secure. For the workers of all the rest of Europe
        need the independence of Poland just as much as the Polish workers
        themselves. F. Engels London, February 10, 1892 Preface to The 1893
        Italian Edition Publication of the Manifesto of the Communist Party
        coincided, one may say, with March 18, 1848, the day of the revolution
        in Milan and Berlin, which were armed uprisings of the two nations
        situated in the centre, the one, of the continent of Europe, the other,
        of the Mediterranean; two nations until then enfeebled by division and
        internal strife, and thus fallen under foreign domination. While Italy
        was subject to the Emperor of Austria, Germany underwent the yoke, not
        less effective though more indirect, of the Tsar of all the Russias. The
        consequences of March 18, 1848, freed both Italy and Germany from this
        disgrace; if from 1848 to 1871 these two great nations were
        reconstituted and somehow again put on their own, it was as Karl Marx
        used to say, because the men who suppressed the Revolution of 1848 were,
        nevertheless, its testamentary executors in spite of themselves.
        Everywhere that revolution was the work of the working class; it was the
        latter that built the barricades and paid with its lifeblood. Only the
        Paris workers, in overthrowing the government, had the very definite
        intention of overthrowing the bourgeois regime. But conscious though
        they were of the fatal antagonism existing between their own class and
        the bourgeoisie, still, neither the economic progress of the country nor
        the intellectual development of the mass of French workers had as yet
        reached the stage which would have made a social reconstruction
        possible. In the final analysis, therefore, the fruits of the revolution
        were reaped by the capitalist class. In the other countries, in Italy,
        in Germany, in Austria, the workers, from the very outset, did nothing
        but raise the bourgeoisie to power. But in any country the rule of the
        bourgeoisie is impossible without national independence Therefore, the
        Revolution of 1848 had to bring in its train the unity and autonomy of
        the nations that had lacked them up to then: Italy, Germany, Hungary.
        Poland will follow in turn. Thus, if the Revolution of 1848 was not a
        socialist revolution, it paved the way, prepared the ground for the
        latter. Through the impetus given to large-scaled industry in all
        countries, the bourgeois regime during the last forty-five years has
        everywhere created a numerous, concentrated and powerful proletariat. It
        has thus raised, to use the language of the Manifesto, its own
        grave-diggers. Without restoring autonomy and unity to each nation, it
        will be impossible to achieve the international union of the
        proletariat, or the peaceful and intelligent co-operation of these
        nations toward common aims. Just imagine joint international action by
        the Italian, Hungarian, German, Polish and Russian workers under the
        political conditions preceding 1848! The battles fought in 1848 were
        thus not fought in vain. Nor have the forty-five years separating us
        from that revolutionary epoch passed to no purpose. The fruits are
        ripening, and all I wish is that the publication of this Italian
        translation may augur as well for the victory of the Italian proletariat
        as the publication of the original did for the international revolution.
        The Manifesto does full justice to the revolutionary part played by
        capitalism in the past. The first capitalist nation was Italy. The close
        of the feudal Middle Ages, and the opening of the modern capitalist era
        are marked by a colossal figured: an Italian, Dante, both the last poet
        of the Middle Ages and the first poet of modern times. Today, as in
        1300, a new historical era is approaching. Will Italy give us the new
        Dante, who will mark the hour of birth of this new, proletarian era?
        Frederick Engels London, February 1, 1893 Manifesto of the Communist
        Party A spectre is haunting Europe – the spectre of communism. All the
        powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this
        spectre: Pope and Tsar, Metternich and Guizot, French Radicals and
        German police-spies. Where is the party in opposition that has not been
        decried as communistic by its opponents in power? Where is the
        opposition that has not hurled back the branding reproach of communism,
        against the more advanced opposition parties, as well as against its
        reactionary adversaries? Two things result from this fact: I. Communism
        is already acknowledged by all European powers to be itself a power. II.
        It is high time that Communists should openly, in the face of the whole
        world, publish their views, their aims, their tendencies, and meet this
        nursery tale of the Spectre of Communism with a manifesto of the party
        itself. To this end, Communists of various nationalities have assembled
        in London and sketched the following manifesto, to be published in the
        English, French, German, Italian, Flemish and Danish languages. I.
        Bourgeois and Proletarians[* By bourgeoisie is meant the class of modern
        capitalists, owners of the means of social production and employers of
        wage labour. By proletariat, the class of modern wage labourers who,
        having no means of production of their own, are reduced to selling their
        labour power in order to live. [Engels, 1888 English edition] ]* The
        history of all hitherto existing society[† That is, all written history.
        In 1847, the pre-history of society, the social organisation existing
        previous to recorded history, all but unknown. Since then, August von
        Haxthausen (1792-1866) discovered common ownership of land in Russia,
        Georg Ludwig von Maurer proved it to be the social foundation from which
        all Teutonic races started in history, and, by and by, village
        communities were found to be, or to have been, the primitive form of
        society everywhere from India to Ireland. The inner organisation of this
        primitive communistic society was laid bare, in its typical form, by
        Lewis Henry Morgan's (1818-1861) crowning discovery of the true nature
        of the gens and its relation to the tribe. With the dissolution of the
        primeval communities, society begins to be differentiated into separate
        and finally antagonistic classes. I have attempted to retrace this
        dissolution in The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the
        State, second edition, Stuttgart, 1886. [Engels, 1888 English Edition
        and 1890 German Edition (with the last sentence omitted)]]† is the
        history of class struggles. Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian,
        lord and serf, guild-master[‡ Guild-master, that is, a full member of a
        guild, a master within, not a head of a guild. [Engels, 1888 English
        Edition] ]‡ and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in
        constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now
        hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a
        revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin
        of the contending classes. In the earlier epochs of history, we find
        almost everywhere a complicated arrangement of society into various
        orders, a manifold gradation of social rank. In ancient Rome we have
        patricians, knights, plebeians, slaves; in the Middle Ages, feudal
        lords, vassals, guild-masters, journeymen, apprentices, serfs; in almost
        all of these classes, again, subordinate gradations. The modern
        bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has
        not done away with class antagonisms. It has but established new
        classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of
        the old ones. Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses,
        however, this distinct feature: it has simplified class antagonisms.
        Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile
        camps, into two great classes directly facing each other – Bourgeoisie
        and Proletariat. From the serfs of the Middle Ages sprang the chartered
        burghers of the earliest towns. From these burgesses the first elements
        of the bourgeoisie were developed. The discovery of America, the
        rounding of the Cape, opened up fresh ground for the rising bourgeoisie.
        The East-Indian and Chinese markets, the colonisation of America, trade
        with the colonies, the increase in the means of exchange and in
        commodities generally, gave to commerce, to navigation, to industry, an
        impulse never before known, and thereby, to the revolutionary element in
        the tottering feudal society, a rapid development. The feudal system of
        industry, in which industrial production was monopolised by closed
        guilds, now no longer sufficed for the growing wants of the new markets.
        The manufacturing system took its place. The guild-masters were pushed
        on one side by the manufacturing middle class; division of labour
        between the different corporate guilds vanished in the face of division
        of labour in each single workshop. Meantime the markets kept ever
        growing, the demand ever rising. Even manufacturer no longer sufficed.
        Thereupon, steam and machinery revolutionised industrial production. The
        place of manufacture was taken by the giant, Modern Industry; the place
        of the industrial middle class by industrial millionaires, the leaders
        of the whole industrial armies, the modern bourgeois. Modern industry
        has established the world market, for which the discovery of America
        paved the way. This market has given an immense development to commerce,
        to navigation, to communication by land. This development has, in its
        turn, reacted on the extension of industry; and in proportion as
        industry, commerce, navigation, railways extended, in the same
        proportion the bourgeoisie developed, increased its capital, and pushed
        into the background every class handed down from the Middle Ages. We
        see, therefore, how the modern bourgeoisie is itself the product of a
        long course of development, of a series of revolutions in the modes of
        production and of exchange. Each step in the development of the
        bourgeoisie was accompanied by a corresponding political advance of that
        class. An oppressed class under the sway of the feudal nobility, an
        armed and self-governing association in the medieval commune[* This was
        the name given their urban communities by the townsmen of Italy and
        France, after they had purchased or conquered their initial rights of
        self-government from their feudal lords. [Engels, 1890 German edition]
        “Commune” was the name taken in France by the nascent towns even before
        they had conquered from their feudal lords and masters local
        self-government and political rights as the “Third Estate.” Generally
        speaking, for the economical development of the bourgeoisie, England is
        here taken as the typical country, for its political development,
        France. [Engels, 1888 English Edition] ]*: here independent urban
        republic (as in Italy and Germany); there taxable “third estate” of the
        monarchy (as in France); afterwards, in the period of manufacturing
        proper, serving either the semi-feudal or the absolute monarchy as a
        counterpoise against the nobility, and, in fact, cornerstone of the
        great monarchies in general, the bourgeoisie has at last, since the
        establishment of Modern Industry and of the world market, conquered for
        itself, in the modern representative State, exclusive political sway.
        The executive of the modern state is but a committee for managing the
        common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie. The bourgeoisie, historically,
        has played a most revolutionary part. The bourgeoisie, wherever it has
        got the upper hand, has put an end to all feudal, patriarchal, idyllic
        relations. It has pitilessly torn asunder the motley feudal ties that
        bound man to his “natural superiors”, and has left remaining no other
        nexus between man and man than naked self-interest, than callous “cash
        payment”. It has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious
        fervour, of chivalrous enthusiasm, of philistine sentimentalism, in the
        icy water of egotistical calculation. It has resolved personal worth
        into exchange value, and in place of the numberless indefeasible
        chartered freedoms, has set up that single, unconscionable freedom –
        Free Trade. In one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and
        political illusions, it has substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal
        exploitation. The bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation
        hitherto honoured and looked up to with reverent awe. It has converted
        the physician, the lawyer, the priest, the poet, the man of science,
        into its paid wage labourers. The bourgeoisie has torn away from the
        family its sentimental veil, and has reduced the family relation to a
        mere money relation. The bourgeoisie has disclosed how it came to pass
        that the brutal display of vigour in the Middle Ages, which
        reactionaries so much admire, found its fitting complement in the most
        slothful indolence. It has been the first to show what man’s activity
        can bring about. It has accomplished wonders far surpassing Egyptian
        pyramids, Roman aqueducts, and Gothic cathedrals; it has conducted
        expeditions that put in the shade all former Exoduses of nations and
        crusades. The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly
        revolutionising the instruments of production, and thereby the relations
        of production, and with them the whole relations of society.
        Conservation of the old modes of production in unaltered form, was, on
        the contrary, the first condition of existence for all earlier
        industrial classes. Constant revolutionising of production,
        uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting
        uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all
        earlier ones. All fixed, fast-frozen relations, with their train of
        ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept away, all
        new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify. All that is
        solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last
        compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of life, and his
        relations with his kind. The need of a constantly expanding market for
        its products chases the bourgeoisie over the entire surface of the
        globe. It must nestle everywhere, settle everywhere, establish
        connexions everywhere. The bourgeoisie has through its exploitation of
        the world market given a cosmopolitan character to production and
        consumption in every country. To the great chagrin of Reactionists, it
        has drawn from under the feet of industry the national ground on which
        it stood. All old-established national industries have been destroyed or
        are daily being destroyed. They are dislodged by new industries, whose
        introduction becomes a life and death question for all civilised
        nations, by industries that no longer work up indigenous raw material,
        but raw material drawn from the remotest zones; industries whose
        products are consumed, not only at home, but in every quarter of the
        globe. In place of the old wants, satisfied by the production of the
        country, we find new wants, requiring for their satisfaction the
        products of distant lands and climes. In place of the old local and
        national seclusion and self-sufficiency, we have intercourse in every
        direction, universal inter-dependence of nations. And as in material, so
        also in intellectual production. The intellectual creations of
        individual nations become common property. National one-sidedness and
        narrow-mindedness become more and more impossible, and from the numerous
        national and local literatures, there arises a world literature. The
        bourgeoisie, by the rapid improvement of all instruments of production,
        by the immensely facilitated means of communication, draws all, even the
        most barbarian, nations into civilisation. The cheap prices of
        commodities are the heavy artillery with which it batters down all
        Chinese walls, with which it forces the barbarians’ intensely obstinate
        hatred of foreigners to capitulate. It compels all nations, on pain of
        extinction, to adopt the bourgeois mode of production; it compels them
        to introduce what it calls civilisation into their midst, i.e., to
        become bourgeois themselves. In one word, it creates a world after its
        own image. The bourgeoisie has subjected the country to the rule of the
        towns. It has created enormous cities, has greatly increased the urban
        population as compared with the rural, and has thus rescued a
        considerable part of the population from the idiocy of rural life. Just
        as it has made the country dependent on the towns, so it has made
        barbarian and semi-barbarian countries dependent on the civilised ones,
        nations of peasants on nations of bourgeois, the East on the West. The
        bourgeoisie keeps more and more doing away with the scattered state of
        the population, of the means of production, and of property. It has
        agglomerated population, centralised the means of production, and has
        concentrated property in a few hands. The necessary consequence of this
        was political centralisation. Independent, or but loosely connected
        provinces, with separate interests, laws, governments, and systems of
        taxation, became lumped together into one nation, with one government,
        one code of laws, one national class-interest, one frontier, and one
        customs-tariff. The bourgeoisie, during its rule of scarce one hundred
        years, has created more massive and more colossal productive forces than
        have all preceding generations together. Subjection of Nature’s forces
        to man, machinery, application of chemistry to industry and agriculture,
        steam-navigation, railways, electric telegraphs, clearing of whole
        continents for cultivation, canalisation of rivers, whole populations
        conjured out of the ground – what earlier century had even a
        presentiment that such productive forces slumbered in the lap of social
        labour? We see then: the means of production and of exchange, on whose
        foundation the bourgeoisie built itself up, were generated in feudal
        society. At a certain stage in the development of these means of
        production and of exchange, the conditions under which feudal society
        produced and exchanged, the feudal organisation of agriculture and
        manufacturing industry, in one word, the feudal relations of property
        became no longer compatible with the already developed productive
        forces; they became so many fetters. They had to be burst asunder; they
        were burst asunder. Into their place stepped free competition,
        accompanied by a social and political constitution adapted in it, and
        the economic and political sway of the bourgeois class. A similar
        movement is going on before our own eyes. Modern bourgeois society, with
        its relations of production, of exchange and of property, a society that
        has conjured up such gigantic means of production and of exchange, is
        like the sorcerer who is no longer able to control the powers of the
        nether world whom he has called up by his spells. For many a decade past
        the history of industry and commerce is but the history of the revolt of
        modern productive forces against modern conditions of production,
        against the property relations that are the conditions for the existence
        of the bourgeois and of its rule. It is enough to mention the commercial
        crises that by their periodical return put the existence of the entire
        bourgeois society on its trial, each time more threateningly. In these
        crises, a great part not only of the existing products, but also of the
        previously created productive forces, are periodically destroyed. In
        these crises, there breaks out an epidemic that, in all earlier epochs,
        would have seemed an absurdity – the epidemic of over-production.
        Society suddenly finds itself put back into a state of momentary
        barbarism; it appears as if a famine, a universal war of devastation,
        had cut off the supply of every means of subsistence; industry and
        commerce seem to be destroyed; and why? Because there is too much
        civilisation, too much means of subsistence, too much industry, too much
        commerce. The productive forces at the disposal of society no longer
        tend to further the development of the conditions of bourgeois property;
        on the contrary, they have become too powerful for these conditions, by
        which they are fettered, and so soon as they overcome these fetters,
        they bring disorder into the whole of bourgeois society, endanger the
        existence of bourgeois property. The conditions of bourgeois society are
        too narrow to comprise the wealth created by them. And how does the
        bourgeoisie get over these crises? On the one hand by enforced
        destruction of a mass of productive forces; on the other, by the
        conquest of new markets, and by the more thorough exploitation of the
        old ones. That is to say, by paving the way for more extensive and more
        destructive crises, and by diminishing the means whereby crises are
        prevented. The weapons with which the bourgeoisie felled feudalism to
        the ground are now turned against the bourgeoisie itself. But not only
        has the bourgeoisie forged the weapons that bring death to itself; it
        has also called into existence the men who are to wield those weapons –
        the modern working class – the proletarians. In proportion as the
        bourgeoisie, i.e., capital, is developed, in the same proportion is the
        proletariat, the modern working class, developed – a class of labourers,
        who live only so long as they find work, and who find work only so long
        as their labour increases capital. These labourers, who must sell
        themselves piecemeal, are a commodity, like every other article of
        commerce, and are consequently exposed to all the vicissitudes of
        competition, to all the fluctuations of the market. Owing to the
        extensive use of machinery, and to the division of labour, the work of
        the proletarians has lost all individual character, and, consequently,
        all charm for the workman. He becomes an appendage of the machine, and
        it is only the most simple, most monotonous, and most easily acquired
        knack, that is required of him. Hence, the cost of production of a
        workman is restricted, almost entirely, to the means of subsistence that
        he requires for maintenance, and for the propagation of his race. But
        the price of a commodity, and therefore also of labour, is equal to its
        cost of production. In proportion, therefore, as the repulsiveness of
        the work increases, the wage decreases. Nay more, in proportion as the
        use of machinery and division of labour increases, in the same
        proportion the burden of toil also increases, whether by prolongation of
        the working hours, by the increase of the work exacted in a given time
        or by increased speed of machinery, etc. Modern Industry has converted
        the little workshop of the patriarchal master into the great factory of
        the industrial capitalist. Masses of labourers, crowded into the
        factory, are organised like soldiers. As privates of the industrial army
        they are placed under the command of a perfect hierarchy of officers and
        sergeants. Not only are they slaves of the bourgeois class, and of the
        bourgeois State; they are daily and hourly enslaved by the machine, by
        the overlooker, and, above all, by the individual bourgeois manufacturer
        himself. The more openly this despotism proclaims gain to be its end and
        aim, the more petty, the more hateful and the more embittering it is.
        The less the skill and exertion of strength implied in manual labour, in
        other words, the more modern industry becomes developed, the more is the
        labour of men superseded by that of women. Differences of age and sex
        have no longer any distinctive social validity for the working class.
        All are instruments of labour, more or less expensive to use, according
        to their age and sex. No sooner is the exploitation of the labourer by
        the manufacturer, so far, at an end, that he receives his wages in cash,
        than he is set upon by the other portions of the bourgeoisie, the
        landlord, the shopkeeper, the pawnbroker, etc. The lower strata of the
        middle class – the small tradespeople, shopkeepers, and retired
        tradesmen generally, the handicraftsmen and peasants – all these sink
        gradually into the proletariat, partly because their diminutive capital
        does not suffice for the scale on which Modern Industry is carried on,
        and is swamped in the competition with the large capitalists, partly
        because their specialised skill is rendered worthless by new methods of
        production. Thus the proletariat is recruited from all classes of the
        population. The proletariat goes through various stages of development.
        With its birth begins its struggle with the bourgeoisie. At first the
        contest is carried on by individual labourers, then by the workpeople of
        a factory, then by the operative of one trade, in one locality, against
        the individual bourgeois who directly exploits them. They direct their
        attacks not against the bourgeois conditions of production, but against
        the instruments of production themselves; they destroy imported wares
        that compete with their labour, they smash to pieces machinery, they set
        factories ablaze, they seek to restore by force the vanished status of
        the workman of the Middle Ages. At this stage, the labourers still form
        an incoherent mass scattered over the whole country, and broken up by
        their mutual competition. If anywhere they unite to form more compact
        bodies, this is not yet the consequence of their own active union, but
        of the union of the bourgeoisie, which class, in order to attain its own
        political ends, is compelled to set the whole proletariat in motion, and
        is moreover yet, for a time, able to do so. At this stage, therefore,
        the proletarians do not fight their enemies, but the enemies of their
        enemies, the remnants of absolute monarchy, the landowners, the
        non-industrial bourgeois, the petty bourgeois. Thus, the whole
        historical movement is concentrated in the hands of the bourgeoisie;
        every victory so obtained is a victory for the bourgeoisie. But with the
        development of industry, the proletariat not only increases in number;
        it becomes concentrated in greater masses, its strength grows, and it
        feels that strength more. The various interests and conditions of life
        within the ranks of the proletariat are more and more equalised, in
        proportion as machinery obliterates all distinctions of labour, and
        nearly everywhere reduces wages to the same low level. The growing
        competition among the bourgeois, and the resulting commercial crises,
        make the wages of the workers ever more fluctuating. The increasing
        improvement of machinery, ever more rapidly developing, makes their
        livelihood more and more precarious; the collisions between individual
        workmen and individual bourgeois take more and more the character of
        collisions between two classes. Thereupon, the workers begin to form
        combinations (Trades’ Unions) against the bourgeois; they club together
        in order to keep up the rate of wages; they found permanent associations
        in order to make provision beforehand for these occasional revolts. Here
        and there, the contest breaks out into riots. Now and then the workers
        are victorious, but only for a time. The real fruit of their battles
        lies, not in the immediate result, but in the ever expanding union of
        the workers. This union is helped on by the improved means of
        communication that are created by modern industry, and that place the
        workers of different localities in contact with one another. It was just
        this contact that was needed to centralise the numerous local struggles,
        all of the same character, into one national struggle between classes.
        But every class struggle is a political struggle. And that union, to
        attain which the burghers of the Middle Ages, with their miserable
        highways, required centuries, the modern proletarian, thanks to
        railways, achieve in a few years. This organisation of the proletarians
        into a class, and, consequently into a political party, is continually
        being upset again by the competition between the workers themselves. But
        it ever rises up again, stronger, firmer, mightier. It compels
        legislative recognition of particular interests of the workers, by
        taking advantage of the divisions among the bourgeoisie itself. Thus,
        the ten-hours’ bill in England was carried. Altogether collisions
        between the classes of the old society further, in many ways, the course
        of development of the proletariat. The bourgeoisie finds itself involved
        in a constant battle. At first with the aristocracy; later on, with
        those portions of the bourgeoisie itself, whose interests have become
        antagonistic to the progress of industry; at all time with the
        bourgeoisie of foreign countries. In all these battles, it sees itself
        compelled to appeal to the proletariat, to ask for help, and thus, to
        drag it into the political arena. The bourgeoisie itself, therefore,
        supplies the proletariat with its own elements of political and general
        education, in other words, it furnishes the proletariat with weapons for
        fighting the bourgeoisie. Further, as we have already seen, entire
        sections of the ruling class are, by the advance of industry,
        precipitated into the proletariat, or are at least threatened in their
        conditions of existence. These also supply the proletariat with fresh
        elements of enlightenment and progress. Finally, in times when the class
        struggle nears the decisive hour, the progress of dissolution going on
        within the ruling class, in fact within the whole range of old society,
        assumes such a violent, glaring character, that a small section of the
        ruling class cuts itself adrift, and joins the revolutionary class, the
        class that holds the future in its hands. Just as, therefore, at an
        earlier period, a section of the nobility went over to the bourgeoisie,
        so now a portion of the bourgeoisie goes over to the proletariat, and in
        particular, a portion of the bourgeois ideologists, who have raised
        themselves to the level of comprehending theoretically the historical
        movement as a whole. Of all the classes that stand face to face with the
        bourgeoisie today, the proletariat alone is a really revolutionary
        class. The other classes decay and finally disappear in the face of
        Modern Industry; the proletariat is its special and essential product.
        The lower middle class, the small manufacturer, the shopkeeper, the
        artisan, the peasant, all these fight against the bourgeoisie, to save
        from extinction their existence as fractions of the middle class. They
        are therefore not revolutionary, but conservative. Nay more, they are
        reactionary, for they try to roll back the wheel of history. If by
        chance, they are revolutionary, they are only so in view of their
        impending transfer into the proletariat; they thus defend not their
        present, but their future interests, they desert their own standpoint to
        place themselves at that of the proletariat. The “dangerous class”,
        [lumpenproletariat] the social scum, that passively rotting mass thrown
        off by the lowest layers of the old society, may, here and there, be
        swept into the movement by a proletarian revolution; its conditions of
        life, however, prepare it far more for the part of a bribed tool of
        reactionary intrigue. In the condition of the proletariat, those of old
        society at large are already virtually swamped. The proletarian is
        without property; his relation to his wife and children has no longer
        anything in common with the bourgeois family relations; modern industry
        labour, modern subjection to capital, the same in England as in France,
        in America as in Germany, has stripped him of every trace of national
        character. Law, morality, religion, are to him so many bourgeois
        prejudices, behind which lurk in ambush just as many bourgeois
        interests. All the preceding classes that got the upper hand sought to
        fortify their already acquired status by subjecting society at large to
        their conditions of appropriation. The proletarians cannot become
        masters of the productive forces of society, except by abolishing their
        own previous mode of appropriation, and thereby also every other
        previous mode of appropriation. They have nothing of their own to secure
        and to fortify; their mission is to destroy all previous securities for,
        and insurances of, individual property. All previous historical
        movements were movements of minorities, or in the interest of
        minorities. The proletarian movement is the self-conscious, independent
        movement of the immense majority, in the interest of the immense
        majority. The proletariat, the lowest stratum of our present society,
        cannot stir, cannot raise itself up, without the whole superincumbent
        strata of official society being sprung into the air. Though not in
        substance, yet in form, the struggle of the proletariat with the
        bourgeoisie is at first a national struggle. The proletariat of each
        country must, of course, first of all settle matters with its own
        bourgeoisie. In depicting the most general phases of the development of
        the proletariat, we traced the more or less veiled civil war, raging
        within existing society, up to the point where that war breaks out into
        open revolution, and where the violent overthrow of the bourgeoisie lays
        the foundation for the sway of the proletariat. Hitherto, every form of
        society has been based, as we have already seen, on the antagonism of
        oppressing and oppressed classes. But in order to oppress a class,
        certain conditions must be assured to it under which it can, at least,
        continue its slavish existence. The serf, in the period of serfdom,
        raised himself to membership in the commune, just as the petty
        bourgeois, under the yoke of the feudal absolutism, managed to develop
        into a bourgeois. The modern labourer, on the contrary, instead of
        rising with the process of industry, sinks deeper and deeper below the
        conditions of existence of his own class. He becomes a pauper, and
        pauperism develops more rapidly than population and wealth. And here it
        becomes evident, that the bourgeoisie is unfit any longer to be the
        ruling class in society, and to impose its conditions of existence upon
        society as an over-riding law. It is unfit to rule because it is
        incompetent to assure an existence to its slave within his slavery,
        because it cannot help letting him sink into such a state, that it has
        to feed him, instead of being fed by him. Society can no longer live
        under this bourgeoisie, in other words, its existence is no longer
        compatible with society. The essential conditions for the existence and
        for the sway of the bourgeois class is the formation and augmentation of
        capital; the condition for capital is wage-labour. Wage-labour rests
        exclusively on competition between the labourers. The advance of
        industry, whose involuntary promoter is the bourgeoisie, replaces the
        isolation of the labourers, due to competition, by the revolutionary
        combination, due to association. The development of Modern Industry,
        therefore, cuts from under its feet the very foundation on which the
        bourgeoisie produces and appropriates products. What the bourgeoisie
        therefore produces, above all, are its own grave-diggers. Its fall and
        the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable. II. Proletarians
        and Communists In what relation do the Communists stand to the
        proletarians as a whole? The Communists do not form a separate party
        opposed to the other working-class parties. They have no interests
        separate and apart from those of the proletariat as a whole. They do not
        set up any sectarian principles of their own, by which to shape and
        mould the proletarian movement. The Communists are distinguished from
        the other working-class parties by this only: 1. In the national
        struggles of the proletarians of the different countries, they point out
        and bring to the front the common interests of the entire proletariat,
        independently of all nationality. 2. In the various stages of
        development which the struggle of the working class against the
        bourgeoisie has to pass through, they always and everywhere represent
        the interests of the movement as a whole. The Communists, therefore, are
        on the one hand, practically, the most advanced and resolute section of
        the working-class parties of every country, that section which pushes
        forward all others; on the other hand, theoretically, they have over the
        great mass of the proletariat the advantage of clearly understanding the
        line of march, the conditions, and the ultimate general results of the
        proletarian movement. The immediate aim of the Communists is the same as
        that of all other proletarian parties: formation of the proletariat into
        a class, overthrow of the bourgeois supremacy, conquest of political
        power by the proletariat. The theoretical conclusions of the Communists
        are in no way based on ideas or principles that have been invented, or
        discovered, by this or that would-be universal reformer. They merely
        express, in general terms, actual relations springing from an existing
        class struggle, from a historical movement going on under our very eyes.
        The abolition of existing property relations is not at all a distinctive
        feature of communism. All property relations in the past have
        continually been subject to historical change consequent upon the change
        in historical conditions. The French Revolution, for example, abolished
        feudal property in favour of bourgeois property. The distinguishing
        feature of Communism is not the abolition of property generally, but the
        abolition of bourgeois property. But modern bourgeois private property
        is the final and most complete expression of the system of producing and
        appropriating products, that is based on class antagonisms, on the
        exploitation of the many by the few. In this sense, the theory of the
        Communists may be summed up in the single sentence: Abolition of private
        property. We Communists have been reproached with the desire of
        abolishing the right of personally acquiring property as the fruit of a
        man’s own labour, which property is alleged to be the groundwork of all
        personal freedom, activity and independence. Hard-won, self-acquired,
        self-earned property! Do you mean the property of petty artisan and of
        the small peasant, a form of property that preceded the bourgeois form?
        There is no need to abolish that; the development of industry has to a
        great extent already destroyed it, and is still destroying it daily. Or
        do you mean the modern bourgeois private property? But does wage-labour
        create any property for the labourer? Not a bit. It creates capital,
        i.e., that kind of property which exploits wage-labour, and which cannot
        increase except upon condition of begetting a new supply of wage-labour
        for fresh exploitation. Property, in its present form, is based on the
        antagonism of capital and wage labour. Let us examine both sides of this
        antagonism. To be a capitalist, is to have not only a purely personal,
        but a social status in production. Capital is a collective product, and
        only by the united action of many members, nay, in the last resort, only
        by the united action of all members of society, can it be set in motion.
        Capital is therefore not only personal; it is a social power. When,
        therefore, capital is converted into common property, into the property
        of all members of society, personal property is not thereby transformed
        into social property. It is only the social character of the property
        that is changed. It loses its class character. Let us now take
        wage-labour. The average price of wage-labour is the minimum wage, i.e.,
        that quantum of the means of subsistence which is absolutely requisite
        to keep the labourer in bare existence as a labourer. What, therefore,
        the wage-labourer appropriates by means of his labour, merely suffices
        to prolong and reproduce a bare existence. We by no means intend to
        abolish this personal appropriation of the products of labour, an
        appropriation that is made for the maintenance and reproduction of human
        life, and that leaves no surplus wherewith to command the labour of
        others. All that we want to do away with is the miserable character of
        this appropriation, under which the labourer lives merely to increase
        capital, and is allowed to live only in so far as the interest of the
        ruling class requires it. In bourgeois society, living labour is but a
        means to increase accumulated labour. In Communist society, accumulated
        labour is but a means to widen, to enrich, to promote the existence of
        the labourer. In bourgeois society, therefore, the past dominates the
        present; in Communist society, the present dominates the past. In
        bourgeois society capital is independent and has individuality, while
        the living person is dependent and has no individuality. And the
        abolition of this state of things is called by the bourgeois, abolition
        of individuality and freedom! And rightly so. The abolition of bourgeois
        individuality, bourgeois independence, and bourgeois freedom is
        undoubtedly aimed at. By freedom is meant, under the present bourgeois
        conditions of production, free trade, free selling and buying. But if
        selling and buying disappears, free selling and buying disappears also.
        This talk about free selling and buying, and all the other “brave words”
        of our bourgeois about freedom in general, have a meaning, if any, only
        in contrast with restricted selling and buying, with the fettered
        traders of the Middle Ages, but have no meaning when opposed to the
        Communistic abolition of buying and selling, of the bourgeois conditions
        of production, and of the bourgeoisie itself. You are horrified at our
        intending to do away with private property. But in your existing
        society, private property is already done away with for nine-tenths of
        the population; its existence for the few is solely due to its
        non-existence in the hands of those nine-tenths. You reproach us,
        therefore, with intending to do away with a form of property, the
        necessary condition for whose existence is the non-existence of any
        property for the immense majority of society. In one word, you reproach
        us with intending to do away with your property. Precisely so; that is
        just what we intend. From the moment when labour can no longer be
        converted into capital, money, or rent, into a social power capable of
        being monopolised, i.e., from the moment when individual property can no
        longer be transformed into bourgeois property, into capital, from that
        moment, you say, individuality vanishes. You must, therefore, confess
        that by “individual” you mean no other person than the bourgeois, than
        the middle-class owner of property. This person must, indeed, be swept
        out of the way, and made impossible. Communism deprives no man of the
        power to appropriate the products of society; all that it does is to
        deprive him of the power to subjugate the labour of others by means of
        such appropriations. It has been objected that upon the abolition of
        private property, all work will cease, and universal laziness will
        overtake us. According to this, bourgeois society ought long ago to have
        gone to the dogs through sheer idleness; for those of its members who
        work, acquire nothing, and those who acquire anything do not work. The
        whole of this objection is but another expression of the tautology: that
        there can no longer be any wage-labour when there is no longer any
        capital. All objections urged against the Communistic mode of producing
        and appropriating material products, have, in the same way, been urged
        against the Communistic mode of producing and appropriating intellectual
        products. Just as, to the bourgeois, the disappearance of class property
        is the disappearance of production itself, so the disappearance of class
        culture is to him identical with the disappearance of all culture. That
        culture, the loss of which he laments, is, for the enormous majority, a
        mere training to act as a machine. But don’t wrangle with us so long as
        you apply, to our intended abolition of bourgeois property, the standard
        of your bourgeois notions of freedom, culture, law, &c. Your very ideas
        are but the outgrowth of the conditions of your bourgeois production and
        bourgeois property, just as your jurisprudence is but the will of your
        class made into a law for all, a will whose essential character and
        direction are determined by the economical conditions of existence of
        your class. The selfish misconception that induces you to transform into
        eternal laws of nature and of reason, the social forms springing from
        your present mode of production and form of property – historical
        relations that rise and disappear in the progress of production – this
        misconception you share with every ruling class that has preceded you.
        What you see clearly in the case of ancient property, what you admit in
        the case of feudal property, you are of course forbidden to admit in the
        case of your own bourgeois form of property. Abolition [Aufhebung] of
        the family! Even the most radical flare up at this infamous proposal of
        the Communists. On what foundation is the present family, the bourgeois
        family, based? On capital, on private gain. In its completely developed
        form, this family exists only among the bourgeoisie. But this state of
        things finds its complement in the practical absence of the family among
        the proletarians, and in public prostitution. The bourgeois family will
        vanish as a matter of course when its complement vanishes, and both will
        vanish with the vanishing of capital. Do you charge us with wanting to
        stop the exploitation of children by their parents? To this crime we
        plead guilty. But, you say, we destroy the most hallowed of relations,
        when we replace home education by social. And your education! Is not
        that also social, and determined by the social conditions under which
        you educate, by the intervention direct or indirect, of society, by
        means of schools, &c.? The Communists have not invented the intervention
        of society in education; they do but seek to alter the character of that
        intervention, and to rescue education from the influence of the ruling
        class. The bourgeois clap-trap about the family and education, about the
        hallowed co-relation of parents and child, becomes all the more
        disgusting, the more, by the action of Modern Industry, all the family
        ties among the proletarians are torn asunder, and their children
        transformed into simple articles of commerce and instruments of labour.
        But you Communists would introduce community of women, screams the
        bourgeoisie in chorus. The bourgeois sees his wife a mere instrument of
        production. He hears that the instruments of production are to be
        exploited in common, and, naturally, can come to no other conclusion
        that the lot of being common to all will likewise fall to the women. He
        has not even a suspicion that the real point aimed at is to do away with
        the status of women as mere instruments of production. For the rest,
        nothing is more ridiculous than the virtuous indignation of our
        bourgeois at the community of women which, they pretend, is to be openly
        and officially established by the Communists. The Communists have no
        need to introduce community of women; it has existed almost from time
        immemorial. Our bourgeois, not content with having wives and daughters
        of their proletarians at their disposal, not to speak of common
        prostitutes, take the greatest pleasure in seducing each other’s wives.
        Bourgeois marriage is, in reality, a system of wives in common and thus,
        at the most, what the Communists might possibly be reproached with is
        that they desire to introduce, in substitution for a hypocritically
        concealed, an openly legalised community of women. For the rest, it is
        self-evident that the abolition of the present system of production must
        bring with it the abolition of the community of women springing from
        that system, i.e., of prostitution both public and private. The
        Communists are further reproached with desiring to abolish countries and
        nationality. The working men have no country. We cannot take from them
        what they have not got. Since the proletariat must first of all acquire
        political supremacy, must rise to be the leading class of the nation,
        must constitute itself the nation, it is so far, itself national, though
        not in the bourgeois sense of the word. National differences and
        antagonism between peoples are daily more and more vanishing, owing to
        the development of the bourgeoisie, to freedom of commerce, to the world
        market, to uniformity in the mode of production and in the conditions of
        life corresponding thereto. The supremacy of the proletariat will cause
        them to vanish still faster. United action, of the leading civilised
        countries at least, is one of the first conditions for the emancipation
        of the proletariat. In proportion as the exploitation of one individual
        by another will also be put an end to, the exploitation of one nation by
        another will also be put an end to. In proportion as the antagonism
        between classes within the nation vanishes, the hostility of one nation
        to another will come to an end. The charges against Communism made from
        a religious, a philosophical and, generally, from an ideological
        standpoint, are not deserving of serious examination. Does it require
        deep intuition to comprehend that man’s ideas, views, and conception, in
        one word, man’s consciousness, changes with every change in the
        conditions of his material existence, in his social relations and in his
        social life? What else does the history of ideas prove, than that
        intellectual production changes its character in proportion as material
        production is changed? The ruling ideas of each age have ever been the
        ideas of its ruling class. When people speak of the ideas that
        revolutionise society, they do but express that fact that within the old
        society the elements of a new one have been created, and that the
        dissolution of the old ideas keeps even pace with the dissolution of the
        old conditions of existence. When the ancient world was in its last
        throes, the ancient religions were overcome by Christianity. When
        Christian ideas succumbed in the 18th century to rationalist ideas,
        feudal society fought its death battle with the then revolutionary
        bourgeoisie. The ideas of religious liberty and freedom of conscience
        merely gave expression to the sway of free competition within the domain
        of knowledge. “Undoubtedly,” it will be said, “religious, moral,
        philosophical, and juridical ideas have been modified in the course of
        historical development. But religion, morality, philosophy, political
        science, and law, constantly survived this change.” “There are, besides,
        eternal truths, such as Freedom, Justice, etc., that are common to all
        states of society. But Communism abolishes eternal truths, it abolishes
        all religion, and all morality, instead of constituting them on a new
        basis; it therefore acts in contradiction to all past historical
        experience.” What does this accusation reduce itself to? The history of
        all past society has consisted in the development of class antagonisms,
        antagonisms that assumed different forms at different epochs. But
        whatever form they may have taken, one fact is common to all past ages,
        viz., the exploitation of one part of society by the other. No wonder,
        then, that the social consciousness of past ages, despite all the
        multiplicity and variety it displays, moves within certain common forms,
        or general ideas, which cannot completely vanish except with the total
        disappearance of class antagonisms. The Communist revolution is the most
        radical rupture with traditional property relations; no wonder that its
        development involved the most radical rupture with traditional ideas.
        But let us have done with the bourgeois objections to Communism. We have
        seen above, that the first step in the revolution by the working class
        is to raise the proletariat to the position of ruling class to win the
        battle of democracy. The proletariat will use its political supremacy to
        wrest, by degree, all capital from the bourgeoisie, to centralise all
        instruments of production in the hands of the State, i.e., of the
        proletariat organised as the ruling class; and to increase the total
        productive forces as rapidly as possible. Of course, in the beginning,
        this cannot be effected except by means of despotic inroads on the
        rights of property, and on the conditions of bourgeois production; by
        means of measures, therefore, which appear economically insufficient and
        untenable, but which, in the course of the movement, outstrip
        themselves, necessitate further inroads upon the old social order, and
        are unavoidable as a means of entirely revolutionising the mode of
        production. These measures will, of course, be different in different
        countries. Nevertheless, in most advanced countries, the following will
        be pretty generally applicable. 1. Abolition of property in land and
        application of all rents of land to public purposes. 2. A heavy
        progressive or graduated income tax. 3. Abolition of all rights of
        inheritance. 4. Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and
        rebels. 5. Centralisation of credit in the hands of the state, by means
        of a national bank with State capital and an exclusive monopoly. 6.
        Centralisation of the means of communication and transport in the hands
        of the State. 7. Extension of factories and instruments of production
        owned by the State; the bringing into cultivation of waste-lands, and
        the improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a common plan.
        8. Equal liability of all to work. Establishment of industrial armies,
        especially for agriculture. 9. Combination of agriculture with
        manufacturing industries; gradual abolition of all the distinction
        between town and country by a more equable distribution of the populace
        over the country. 10. Free education for all children in public schools.
        Abolition of children’s factory labour in its present form. Combination
        of education with industrial production, &c, &c. When, in the course of
        development, class distinctions have disappeared, and all production has
        been concentrated in the hands of a vast association of the whole
        nation, the public power will lose its political character. Political
        power, properly so called, is merely the organised power of one class
        for oppressing another. If the proletariat during its contest with the
        bourgeoisie is compelled, by the force of circumstances, to organise
        itself as a class, if, by means of a revolution, it makes itself the
        ruling class, and, as such, sweeps away by force the old conditions of
        production, then it will, along with these conditions, have swept away
        the conditions for the existence of class antagonisms and of classes
        generally, and will thereby have abolished its own supremacy as a class.
        In place of the old bourgeois society, with its classes and class
        antagonisms, we shall have an association, in which the free development
        of each is the condition for the free development of all. III. Socialist
        and Communist Literature 1. Reactionary Socialism A. Feudal Socialism
        Owing to their historical position, it became the vocation of the
        aristocracies of France and England to write pamphlets against modern
        bourgeois society. In the French Revolution of July 1830, and in the
        English reform agitation[ A reference to the movement for an electoral
        reform which, under the pressure of the working class, was passed by the
        British House of Commons in 1831 and finally endorsed by the House of
        Lords in June, 1832. The reform was directed against monopoly rule of
        the landed and finance aristocracy and opened the way to Parliament for
        the representatives of the industrial bourgeoisie. Neither workers nor
        the petty-bourgeois were allowed electoral rights, despite assurances
        they would. ], these aristocracies again succumbed to the hateful
        upstart. Thenceforth, a serious political struggle was altogether out of
        the question. A literary battle alone remained possible. But even in the
        domain of literature the old cries of the restoration period had become
        impossible.[* Not the English Restoration (1660-1689), but the French
        Restoration (1814-1830). [Note by Engels to the English edition of
        1888.] ]* In order to arouse sympathy, the aristocracy was obliged to
        lose sight, apparently, of its own interests, and to formulate their
        indictment against the bourgeoisie in the interest of the exploited
        working class alone. Thus, the aristocracy took their revenge by singing
        lampoons on their new masters and whispering in his ears sinister
        prophesies of coming catastrophe. In this way arose feudal Socialism:
        half lamentation, half lampoon; half an echo of the past, half menace of
        the future; at times, by its bitter, witty and incisive criticism,
        striking the bourgeoisie to the very heart’s core; but always ludicrous
        in its effect, through total incapacity to comprehend the march of
        modern history. The aristocracy, in order to rally the people to them,
        waved the proletarian alms-bag in front for a banner. But the people, so
        often as it joined them, saw on their hindquarters the old feudal coats
        of arms, and deserted with loud and irreverent laughter. One section of
        the French Legitimists and “Young England” exhibited this spectacle. In
        pointing out that their mode of exploitation was different to that of
        the bourgeoisie, the feudalists forget that they exploited under
        circumstances and conditions that were quite different and that are now
        antiquated. In showing that, under their rule, the modern proletariat
        never existed, they forget that the modern bourgeoisie is the necessary
        offspring of their own form of society. For the rest, so little do they
        conceal the reactionary character of their criticism that their chief
        accusation against the bourgeois amounts to this, that under the
        bourgeois régime a class is being developed which is destined to cut up
        root and branch the old order of society. What they upbraid the
        bourgeoisie with is not so much that it creates a proletariat as that it
        creates a revolutionary proletariat. In political practice, therefore,
        they join in all coercive measures against the working class; and in
        ordinary life, despite their high-falutin phrases, they stoop to pick up
        the golden apples dropped from the tree of industry, and to barter
        truth, love, and honour, for traffic in wool, beetroot-sugar, and potato
        spirits.[† This applies chiefly to Germany, where the landed aristocracy
        and squirearchy have large portions of their estates cultivated for
        their own account by stewards, and are, moreover, extensive
        beetroot-sugar manufacturers and distillers of potato spirits. The
        wealthier British aristocracy are, as yet, rather above that; but they,
        too, know how to make up for declining rents by lending their names to
        floaters or more or less shady joint-stock companies. [Note by Engels to
        the English edition of 1888.] ]† As the parson has ever gone hand in
        hand with the landlord, so has Clerical Socialism with Feudal Socialism.
        Nothing is easier than to give Christian asceticism a Socialist tinge.
        Has not Christianity declaimed against private property, against
        marriage, against the State? Has it not preached in the place of these,
        charity and poverty, celibacy and mortification of the flesh, monastic
        life and Mother Church? Christian Socialism is but the holy water with
        which the priest consecrates the heart-burnings of the aristocrat. B.
        Petty-Bourgeois Socialism The feudal aristocracy was not the only class
        that was ruined by the bourgeoisie, not the only class whose conditions
        of existence pined and perished in the atmosphere of modern bourgeois
        society. The medieval burgesses and the small peasant proprietors were
        the precursors of the modern bourgeoisie. In those countries which are
        but little developed, industrially and commercially, these two classes
        still vegetate side by side with the rising bourgeoisie. In countries
        where modern civilisation has become fully developed, a new class of
        petty bourgeois has been formed, fluctuating between proletariat and
        bourgeoisie, and ever renewing itself as a supplementary part of
        bourgeois society. The individual members of this class, however, are
        being constantly hurled down into the proletariat by the action of
        competition, and, as modern industry develops, they even see the moment
        approaching when they will completely disappear as an independent
        section of modern society, to be replaced in manufactures, agriculture
        and commerce, by overlookers, bailiffs and shopmen. In countries like
        France, where the peasants constitute far more than half of the
        population, it was natural that writers who sided with the proletariat
        against the bourgeoisie should use, in their criticism of the bourgeois
        régime, the standard of the peasant and petty bourgeois, and from the
        standpoint of these intermediate classes, should take up the cudgels for
        the working class. Thus arose petty-bourgeois Socialism. Sismondi was
        the head of this school, not only in France but also in England. This
        school of Socialism dissected with great acuteness the contradictions in
        the conditions of modern production. It laid bare the hypocritical
        apologies of economists. It proved, incontrovertibly, the disastrous
        effects of machinery and division of labour; the concentration of
        capital and land in a few hands; overproduction and crises; it pointed
        out the inevitable ruin of the petty bourgeois and peasant, the misery
        of the proletariat, the anarchy in production, the crying inequalities
        in the distribution of wealth, the industrial war of extermination
        between nations, the dissolution of old moral bonds, of the old family
        relations, of the old nationalities. In its positive aims, however, this
        form of Socialism aspires either to restoring the old means of
        production and of exchange, and with them the old property relations,
        and the old society, or to cramping the modern means of production and
        of exchange within the framework of the old property relations that have
        been, and were bound to be, exploded by those means. In either case, it
        is both reactionary and Utopian. Its last words are: corporate guilds
        for manufacture; patriarchal relations in agriculture. Ultimately, when
        stubborn historical facts had dispersed all intoxicating effects of
        self-deception, this form of Socialism ended in a miserable fit of the
        blues. C. German or “True” Socialism The Socialist and Communist
        literature of France, a literature that originated under the pressure of
        a bourgeoisie in power, and that was the expressions of the struggle
        against this power, was introduced into Germany at a time when the
        bourgeoisie, in that country, had just begun its contest with feudal
        absolutism. German philosophers, would-be philosophers, and beaux
        esprits (men of letters), eagerly seized on this literature, only
        forgetting, that when these writings immigrated from France into
        Germany, French social conditions had not immigrated along with them. In
        contact with German social conditions, this French literature lost all
        its immediate practical significance and assumed a purely literary
        aspect. Thus, to the German philosophers of the Eighteenth Century, the
        demands of the first French Revolution were nothing more than the
        demands of “Practical Reason” in general, and the utterance of the will
        of the revolutionary French bourgeoisie signified, in their eyes, the
        laws of pure Will, of Will as it was bound to be, of true human Will
        generally. The work of the German literati consisted solely in bringing
        the new French ideas into harmony with their ancient philosophical
        conscience, or rather, in annexing the French ideas without deserting
        their own philosophic point of view. This annexation took place in the
        same way in which a foreign language is appropriated, namely, by
        translation. It is well known how the monks wrote silly lives of
        Catholic Saints over the manuscripts on which the classical works of
        ancient heathendom had been written. The German literati reversed this
        process with the profane French literature. They wrote their
        philosophical nonsense beneath the French original. For instance,
        beneath the French criticism of the economic functions of money, they
        wrote “Alienation of Humanity”, and beneath the French criticism of the
        bourgeois state they wrote “Dethronement of the Category of the
        General”, and so forth. The introduction of these philosophical phrases
        at the back of the French historical criticisms, they dubbed “Philosophy
        of Action”, “True Socialism”, “German Science of Socialism”,
        “Philosophical Foundation of Socialism”, and so on. The French Socialist
        and Communist literature was thus completely emasculated. And, since it
        ceased in the hands of the German to express the struggle of one class
        with the other, he felt conscious of having overcome “French
        one-sidedness” and of representing, not true requirements, but the
        requirements of Truth; not the interests of the proletariat, but the
        interests of Human Nature, of Man in general, who belongs to no class,
        has no reality, who exists only in the misty realm of philosophical
        fantasy. This German socialism, which took its schoolboy task so
        seriously and solemnly, and extolled its poor stock-in-trade in such a
        mountebank fashion, meanwhile gradually lost its pedantic innocence. The
        fight of the Germans, and especially of the Prussian bourgeoisie,
        against feudal aristocracy and absolute monarchy, in other words, the
        liberal movement, became more earnest. By this, the long-wished for
        opportunity was offered to “True” Socialism of confronting the political
        movement with the Socialist demands, of hurling the traditional
        anathemas against liberalism, against representative government, against
        bourgeois competition, bourgeois freedom of the press, bourgeois
        legislation, bourgeois liberty and equality, and of preaching to the
        masses that they had nothing to gain, and everything to lose, by this
        bourgeois movement. German Socialism forgot, in the nick of time, that
        the French criticism, whose silly echo it was, presupposed the existence
        of modern bourgeois society, with its corresponding economic conditions
        of existence, and the political constitution adapted thereto, the very
        things those attainment was the object of the pending struggle in
        Germany. To the absolute governments, with their following of parsons,
        professors, country squires, and officials, it served as a welcome
        scarecrow against the threatening bourgeoisie. It was a sweet finish,
        after the bitter pills of flogging and bullets, with which these same
        governments, just at that time, dosed the German working-class risings.
        While this “True” Socialism thus served the government as a weapon for
        fighting the German bourgeoisie, it, at the same time, directly
        represented a reactionary interest, the interest of German Philistines.
        In Germany, the petty-bourgeois class, a relic of the sixteenth century,
        and since then constantly cropping up again under the various forms, is
        the real social basis of the existing state of things. To preserve this
        class is to preserve the existing state of things in Germany. The
        industrial and political supremacy of the bourgeoisie threatens it with
        certain destruction – on the one hand, from the concentration of
        capital; on the other, from the rise of a revolutionary proletariat.
        “True” Socialism appeared to kill these two birds with one stone. It
        spread like an epidemic. The robe of speculative cobwebs, embroidered
        with flowers of rhetoric, steeped in the dew of sickly sentiment, this
        transcendental robe in which the German Socialists wrapped their sorry
        “eternal truths”, all skin and bone, served to wonderfully increase the
        sale of their goods amongst such a public. And on its part German
        Socialism recognised, more and more, its own calling as the bombastic
        representative of the petty-bourgeois Philistine. It proclaimed the
        German nation to be the model nation, and the German petty Philistine to
        be the typical man. To every villainous meanness of this model man, it
        gave a hidden, higher, Socialistic interpretation, the exact contrary of
        its real character. It went to the extreme length of directly opposing
        the “brutally destructive” tendency of Communism, and of proclaiming its
        supreme and impartial contempt of all class struggles. With very few
        exceptions, all the so-called Socialist and Communist publications that
        now (1847) circulate in Germany belong to the domain of this foul and
        enervating literature.[* The revolutionary storm of 1848 swept away this
        whole shabby tendency and cured its protagonists of the desire to dabble
        in socialism. The chief representative and classical type of this
        tendency is Mr Karl Gruen. [Note by Engels to the German edition of
        1890.]]* 2. Conservative or Bourgeois Socialism A part of the
        bourgeoisie is desirous of redressing social grievances in order to
        secure the continued existence of bourgeois society. To this section
        belong economists, philanthropists, humanitarians, improvers of the
        condition of the working class, organisers of charity, members of
        societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals, temperance fanatics,
        hole-and-corner reformers of every imaginable kind. This form of
        socialism has, moreover, been worked out into complete systems. We may
        cite Proudhon’s Philosophie de la Misère as an example of this form. The
        Socialistic bourgeois want all the advantages of modern social
        conditions without the struggles and dangers necessarily resulting
        therefrom. They desire the existing state of society, minus its
        revolutionary and disintegrating elements. They wish for a bourgeoisie
        without a proletariat. The bourgeoisie naturally conceives the world in
        which it is supreme to be the best; and bourgeois Socialism develops
        this comfortable conception into various more or less complete systems.
        In requiring the proletariat to carry out such a system, and thereby to
        march straightway into the social New Jerusalem, it but requires in
        reality, that the proletariat should remain within the bounds of
        existing society, but should cast away all its hateful ideas concerning
        the bourgeoisie. A second, and more practical, but less systematic, form
        of this Socialism sought to depreciate every revolutionary movement in
        the eyes of the working class by showing that no mere political reform,
        but only a change in the material conditions of existence, in economical
        relations, could be of any advantage to them. By changes in the material
        conditions of existence, this form of Socialism, however, by no means
        understands abolition of the bourgeois relations of production, an
        abolition that can be affected only by a revolution, but administrative
        reforms, based on the continued existence of these relations; reforms,
        therefore, that in no respect affect the relations between capital and
        labour, but, at the best, lessen the cost, and simplify the
        administrative work, of bourgeois government. Bourgeois Socialism
        attains adequate expression when, and only when, it becomes a mere
        figure of speech. Free trade: for the benefit of the working class.
        Protective duties: for the benefit of the working class. Prison Reform:
        for the benefit of the working class. This is the last word and the only
        seriously meant word of bourgeois socialism. It is summed up in the
        phrase: the bourgeois is a bourgeois – for the benefit of the working
        class. 3. Critical-Utopian Socialism and Communism We do not here refer
        to that literature which, in every great modern revolution, has always
        given voice to the demands of the proletariat, such as the writings of
        Babeuf and others. The first direct attempts of the proletariat to
        attain its own ends, made in times of universal excitement, when feudal
        society was being overthrown, necessarily failed, owing to the then
        undeveloped state of the proletariat, as well as to the absence of the
        economic conditions for its emancipation, conditions that had yet to be
        produced, and could be produced by the impending bourgeois epoch alone.
        The revolutionary literature that accompanied these first movements of
        the proletariat had necessarily a reactionary character. It inculcated
        universal asceticism and social levelling in its crudest form. The
        Socialist and Communist systems, properly so called, those of
        Saint-Simon, Fourier, Owen, and others, spring into existence in the
        early undeveloped period, described above, of the struggle between
        proletariat and bourgeoisie (see Section I. Bourgeois and Proletarians).
        The founders of these systems see, indeed, the class antagonisms, as
        well as the action of the decomposing elements in the prevailing form of
        society. But the proletariat, as yet in its infancy, offers to them the
        spectacle of a class without any historical initiative or any
        independent political movement. Since the development of class
        antagonism keeps even pace with the development of industry, the
        economic situation, as they find it, does not as yet offer to them the
        material conditions for the emancipation of the proletariat. They
        therefore search after a new social science, after new social laws, that
        are to create these conditions. Historical action is to yield to their
        personal inventive action; historically created conditions of
        emancipation to fantastic ones; and the gradual, spontaneous class
        organisation of the proletariat to an organisation of society especially
        contrived by these inventors. Future history resolves itself, in their
        eyes, into the propaganda and the practical carrying out of their social
        plans. In the formation of their plans, they are conscious of caring
        chiefly for the interests of the working class, as being the most
        suffering class. Only from the point of view of being the most suffering
        class does the proletariat exist for them. The undeveloped state of the
        class struggle, as well as their own surroundings, causes Socialists of
        this kind to consider themselves far superior to all class antagonisms.
        They want to improve the condition of every member of society, even that
        of the most favoured. Hence, they habitually appeal to society at large,
        without the distinction of class; nay, by preference, to the ruling
        class. For how can people, when once they understand their system, fail
        to see in it the best possible plan of the best possible state of
        society? Hence, they reject all political, and especially all
        revolutionary action; they wish to attain their ends by peaceful means,
        necessarily doomed to failure, and by the force of example, to pave the
        way for the new social Gospel. Such fantastic pictures of future
        society, painted at a time when the proletariat is still in a very
        undeveloped state and has but a fantastic conception of its own
        position, correspond with the first instinctive yearnings of that class
        for a general reconstruction of society. But these Socialist and
        Communist publications contain also a critical element. They attack
        every principle of existing society. Hence, they are full of the most
        valuable materials for the enlightenment of the working class. The
        practical measures proposed in them – such as the abolition of the
        distinction between town and country, of the family, of the carrying on
        of industries for the account of private individuals, and of the wage
        system, the proclamation of social harmony, the conversion of the
        function of the state into a more superintendence of production – all
        these proposals point solely to the disappearance of class antagonisms
        which were, at that time, only just cropping up, and which, in these
        publications, are recognised in their earliest indistinct and undefined
        forms only. These proposals, therefore, are of a purely Utopian
        character. The significance of Critical-Utopian Socialism and Communism
        bears an inverse relation to historical development. In proportion as
        the modern class struggle develops and takes definite shape, this
        fantastic standing apart from the contest, these fantastic attacks on
        it, lose all practical value and all theoretical justification.
        Therefore, although the originators of these systems were, in many
        respects, revolutionary, their disciples have, in every case, formed
        mere reactionary sects. They hold fast by the original views of their
        masters, in opposition to the progressive historical development of the
        proletariat. They, therefore, endeavour, and that consistently, to
        deaden the class struggle and to reconcile the class antagonisms. They
        still dream of experimental realisation of their social Utopias, of
        founding isolated “phalansteres”, of establishing “Home Colonies”, or
        setting up a “Little Icaria”[* Phalanstéres were Socialist colonies on
        the plan of Charles Fourier; Icaria was the name given by Cabet to his
        Utopia and, later on, to his American Communist colony. [Note by Engels
        to the English edition of 1888.] “Home Colonies” were what Owen called
        his Communist model societies. Phalanstéres was the name of the public
        palaces planned by Fourier. Icaria was the name given to the Utopian
        land of fancy, whose Communist institutions Cabet portrayed. [Note by
        Engels to the German edition of 1890.]]* – duodecimo editions of the New
        Jerusalem – and to realise all these castles in the air, they are
        compelled to appeal to the feelings and purses of the bourgeois. By
        degrees, they sink into the category of the reactionary [or]
        conservative Socialists depicted above, differing from these only by
        more systematic pedantry, and by their fanatical and superstitious
        belief in the miraculous effects of their social science. They,
        therefore, violently oppose all political action on the part of the
        working class; such action, according to them, can only result from
        blind unbelief in the new Gospel. The Owenites in England, and the
        Fourierists in France, respectively, oppose the Chartists and the
        Réformistes. IV. Position of the Communists in Relation to the Various
        Existing Opposition Parties Section II has made clear the relations of
        the Communists to the existing working-class parties, such as the
        Chartists in England and the Agrarian Reformers in America. The
        Communists fight for the attainment of the immediate aims, for the
        enforcement of the momentary interests of the working class; but in the
        movement of the present, they also represent and take care of the future
        of that movement. In France, the Communists ally with the
        Social-Democrats[* The party then represented in Parliament by
        Ledru-Rollin, in literature by Louis Blanc, in the daily press by the
        Réforme. The name of Social-Democracy signifies, with these its
        inventors, a section of the Democratic or Republican Party more or less
        tinged with socialism. [Engels, English Edition 1888] ]* against the
        conservative and radical bourgeoisie, reserving, however, the right to
        take up a critical position in regard to phases and illusions
        traditionally handed down from the great Revolution. In Switzerland,
        they support the Radicals, without losing sight of the fact that this
        party consists of antagonistic elements, partly of Democratic
        Socialists, in the French sense, partly of radical bourgeois. In Poland,
        they support the party that insists on an agrarian revolution as the
        prime condition for national emancipation, that party which fomented the
        insurrection of Cracow in 1846. In Germany, they fight with the
        bourgeoisie whenever it acts in a revolutionary way, against the
        absolute monarchy, the feudal squirearchy, and the petty bourgeoisie.
        But they never cease, for a single instant, to instil into the working
        class the clearest possible recognition of the hostile antagonism
        between bourgeoisie and proletariat, in order that the German workers
        may straightway use, as so many weapons against the bourgeoisie, the
        social and political conditions that the bourgeoisie must necessarily
        introduce along with its supremacy, and in order that, after the fall of
        the reactionary classes in Germany, the fight against the bourgeoisie
        itself may immediately begin. The Communists turn their attention
        chiefly to Germany, because that country is on the eve of a bourgeois
        revolution that is bound to be carried out under more advanced
        conditions of European civilisation and with a much more developed
        proletariat than that of England was in the seventeenth, and France in
        the eighteenth century, and because the bourgeois revolution in Germany
        will be but the prelude to an immediately following proletarian
        revolution. In short, the Communists everywhere support every
        revolutionary movement against the existing social and political order
        of things. In all these movements, they bring to the front, as the
        leading question in each, the property question, no matter what its
        degree of development at the time. Finally, they labour everywhere for
        the union and agreement of the democratic parties of all countries. The
        Communists disdain to conceal their views and aims. They openly declare
        that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all
        existing social conditions. Let the ruling classes tremble at a
        Communistic revolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but their
        chains. They have a world to win. Working Men of All Countries, Unite![
        The famous final phrase of the Manifesto, “Working Men of All Countries,
        Unite!”, in the original German is: “Proletarier aller Länder, vereinigt
        euch!” Thus, a more correct translation would be “Proletarians of all
        countries, Unite!” “Workers of the World, Unite. You have nothing to
        lose but your chains!” is a popularisation of the last three sentences,
        and is not found in any official translation. Since this English
        translation was approved by Engels, we have kept the original intact.]
        Letter from Engels to Marx, 24 November 1847[* From MECW Volume 38, p.
        146; Written: 24 November 1847; First published: in Der Briefwechsel
        zwischen F. Engels und K. Marx, 1913.]* Paris, 23-24 November 1847 Dear
        Marx, Not until this evening was it decided that I should be coming.
        Saturday evening, then, in Ostend, Hôtel de la Couronne, just opposite
        the railway station beside the harbour, and Sunday morning across the
        water. If you take the train that leaves between 4 and 5, you’ll arrive
        at about the same time as I do. ... Tuesday evening Verte [PTO] Give a
        little thought to the “Confession of Faith.” I think we would do best to
        abandon the catechetical form and call the thing “Communist Manifesto.”
        Since a certain amount of history has to be narrated in it, the form
        hitherto adopted is quite unsuitable. I shall be bringing with me the
        one from here, which I did [“Principles of Communism”]; it is in simple
        narrative form, but wretchedly worded, in a tearing hurry. I start off
        by asking: What is communism? and then straight on to the proletariat –
        the history of its origins, how it differs from earlier workers,
        development of the antithesis between the proletariat and the
        bourgeoisie, crises, conclusions. In between, all kinds of secondary
        matter and, finally, the communists’ party policy, in so far as it
        should be made public. The one here has not yet been submitted in its
        entirety for endorsement but, save for a few quite minor points, I think
        I can get it through in such a form that at least there is nothing in it
        which conflicts with our views. ... Draft of a Communist Confession of

        the First Congress of the Communist League in London on June 2-9, 1847.
        The Congress was a final stage in the reorganisation of the League of
        the Just – an organisation of German workers and craftsmen, which was
        founded in Paris in 1836-37 and soon acquired an international
        character, having communities in Germany, France, Switzerland, Britain
        and Sweden. The activity of Marx and Engels directed towards the
        ideological and organisational unity of the socialists and advanced
        workers prompted the leaders of the League (Karl Schapper, Joseph Moll,
        Heinrich Bauer), who resided in London front November 1846, to ask for
        their help in reorganising the League and drafting its new program me.
        When Marx and Engels were convinced that the leaders of the League of
        the Just were ready to accept the principles of scientific communism as
        its programme they accepted the offer to join the League made to them
        late in January 1847. Engels’ active participation in the work of the
        Congress (Marx was unable to go to London) affected the course and the
        results of its proceedings. The League was renamed the Communist League,
        the old motto of the League of the Just “All men are brothers” was
        replaced by a new, Marxist one: “Working Men of All Countries, Unite! “
        The draft programme and the draft Rules of the League were approved at
        the last sitting on June 9, 1847. The full text of the “Draft of a
        Communist Confession of Faith” (Credo) became known only in 1968. It was
        found by the Swiss scholar Bert Andréas together with the draft Rules
        and the circular of the First Congress to the members of the League in
        the archives of Joachim Friedrich Martens, an active member of the
        Communist League, which are kept in the State and University Library in
        Hamburg. This discovery made it possible to ascertain a number of
        important points in the history of the Communist League and the drafting
        of its programme documents. It had been previously assumed that the
        First Congress did no more than adopt a decision to draw up a programme
        and that the draft itself was made by the London Central Authority of
        the Communist League (Joseph Moll, Karl Schapper and Heinrich Bauer)
        after the Congress between June and August 1847. The new documents show
        that the draft was ready by June 9, 1847 and that its author was Engels
        (the manuscript found in Martens’ archives, with the exception of some
        inserted words, the concluding sentence and the signatures of the
        president and the secretary of the Congress, was written in Engels’
        hand). The document testifies to Engels’ great influence on the
        discussion of the programme at the Congress – the formulation of the
        answers to most of the questions is a Marxist one. Besides, while
        drafting the programme, Engels had to take into account that the members
        of the League had not yet freed themselves from the influence of utopian
        ideas and this was reflected in the formulation of the first six
        questions and answers. The form of a “revolutionary catechism” was also
        commonly used in the League of the Just and other organisations of
        workers and craftsmen at the time. It may he assumed that Engels
        intended to give greater precision to some of the formulations of the
        programme document in the course of further discussion and revision.
        After the First Congress of the Communist League, the “Draft of a
        Communist Confession of Faith” was sent, together with the draft Rules,
        to the communities for discussion, the results of which were to be taken
        into account at the time of the final approval of the programme and the
        Rules at the Second Congress. When working on another, improved draft
        programme, the Principles of Communism, in late October 1847, Engels
        made direct use of the “Confession of Faith”, as can be seen from the
        coincidences of the texts, and also from references in the Principles to
        the earlier document when Engels had apparently decided to leave
        formulations of some of the answers as they were. A Communist Confession
        of Faith Question 1: Are you a Communist? Answer: Yes. Question 2: What
        is the aim of the Communists? Answer: To organise society in such a way
        that every member of it can develop and use all his capabilities and
        powers in complete freedom and without thereby infringing the basic
        conditions of this society. Question 3: How do you wish to achieve this
        aim? Answer: By the elimination of private property and its replacement
        by community of property. Question 4: On what do you base your community
        of property? Answer: Firstly, on the mass of productive forces and means
        of subsistence resulting from the development of industry, agriculture,
        trade and colonisation, and on the possibility inherent in machinery,
        chemical and other resources of their infinite extension. Secondly, on
        the fact that in the consciousness or feeling of every individual there
        exist certain irrefutable basic principles which, being the result of
        the whole of historical development, require no proof. Question 5: What
        are such principles? Answer: For example, every individual strives to be
        happy. The happiness of the individual is inseparable from the happiness
        of all, etc. Question 6: How do you wish to prepare the way for your
        community of property? Answer: By enlightening and uniting the
        proletariat. Question 7: What is the proletariat? Answer: The
        proletariat is that class of society which lives exclusively by its
        labour and not on the profit from any kind of capital; that class whose
        weal and woe, whose life and death, therefore, depend on the alternation
        of times of good and bad business;. in a word, on the fluctuations of
        competition. Question 8: Then there have not always been proletarians?
        Answer: No. There have always been poor and working classes; and those
        who worked were almost always the poor. But there have not always been
        proletarians, just as competition has not always been free. Question 9:
        How did the proletariat arise? Answer: The proletariat came into being
        as a result of the introduction of the machines which have been invented
        since the middle of the last century and the most important of which
        are: the steam-engine, the spinning machine and the power loom. These
        machines, which were very expensive and could therefore only be
        purchased by rich people, supplanted the workers of the time, because by
        the use of machinery it was possible to produce commodities more quickly
        and cheaply than could the workers with their imperfect spinning wheels
        and hand-looms. The machines thus delivered industry entirely into the
        hands of the big capitalists and rendered the workers’ scanty property
        which consisted mainly of their tools, looms, etc., quite worthless, so
        that the capitalist was left with everything, the worker with nothing.
        In this way the factory system was introduced. Once the capitalists saw
        how advantageous this was for them, they sought to extend it to more and
        more branches of labour. They divided work more and more between the
        workers so that workers who formerly had made a whole article now
        produced only a part of it. Labour simplified in this way produced goods
        more quickly and therefore more cheaply and only now was it found in
        almost every branch of labour that here also machines could be used. As
        soon as any branch of labour went over to factory production it ended
        up, just as in the case of spinning and weaving. in the hands of the big
        capitalists, and the workers were deprived of the last remnants of their
        independence. We have gradually arrived at the position where almost all
        branches of labour are run on a factory basis. This has increasingly
        brought about the ruin of the previously existing middle class,
        especially of the small master craftsmen, completely transformed the
        previous position of the workers, and two new classes which are
        gradually swallowing up all other classes have come into being, namely:
        I. The, class of the big capitalists, who in all advanced countries are
        in almost exclusive possession of the means of subsistence and those
        means (machines, factories, workshops, etc.) by which these means of
        subsistence are produced. This is the bourgeois class, or the
        bourgeoisie. II. The class of the completely propertyless, who are
        compelled to sell their labour to the first class, the bourgeois, simply
        to obtain from them in return their means of subsistence. Since the
        parties to this trading in labour are not equal, but the bourgeois have
        the advantage, the propertyless must submit to the bad conditions laid
        down by the bourgeois. This class, dependent on the bourgeois, is called
        the class of the proletarians or the proletariat. Question 10: In what
        way does the proletarian differ from the slave? Answer: The slave is
        sold once and for all, the proletarian has to sell himself by the day
        and by the hour. The slave is the property of one master and for that
        very reason has a guaranteed subsistence, however wretched it may be.
        The proletarian is, so to speak, the slave of the entire bourgeois
        class, not of one master, and therefore has no guaranteed subsistence,
        since nobody buys his labour if he does not need it. The slave is
        accounted a thing and not a member of civil society. The proletarian is
        recognised as a person, as a member of civil society. The slave may,
        therefore, have a better subsistence than the proletarian but the latter
        stands at a higher stage of development. The slave frees himself by
        becoming a proletarian, abolishing from the totality of property
        relationships only the relationship of slavery. The proletarian can free
        himself only by abolishing property in general. Question 11: In what way
        does the proletarian differ from the serf? Answer: The serf has the use
        of a piece of land, that is, of an instrument of production, in return
        for handing over a greater or lesser portion of the yield. The
        proletarian works with instruments of production which belong to someone
        else who, in return for his labour, hands over to him a portion,
        determined by competition, of the products. In the case of the serf, the
        share of the labourer is determined by his own labour, that is, by
        himself. In the case of the proletarian it is determined by competition,
        therefore in the first place by the bourgeois. The serf has guaranteed
        subsistence, the proletarian has not. The serf frees himself by driving
        out his feudal lord and becoming a property owner himself, thus entering
        into competition and joining for the time being the possessing class,
        the privileged class. The proletarian frees himself by doing away with
        property, competition, and all class differences. Question 12: In what
        way does the proletarian differ from the handicraftsman? Answer: As
        opposed to the proletarian, the so-called handicraftsman, who still
        existed nearly everywhere during the last century and still exists here
        and there, is at most a temporary proletarian. His aim is to acquire
        capital himself and so to exploit other workers. He can often achieve
        this aim where the craft guilds still exist or where freedom to follow a
        trade has not yet led to the organisation of handwork on a factory basis
        and to intense competition. But as soon as the factory system is
        introduced into handwork and competition is in full swing, this prospect
        is eliminated and the handicraftsman becomes more and more a
        proletarian. The handicraftsman therefore frees himself either by
        becoming a bourgeois or in general passing over into the middle class,
        or, by becoming a proletarian as a result of competition (as now happens
        in most cases) and joining the movement of the proletariat – i. e., the
        more or less conscious communist movement. Question 13: Then you do not
        believe that community of property has been possible at any time?
        Answer: No. Communism has only arisen since machinery and other
        inventions made it possible to hold out the prospect of an all-sided
        development, a happy existence, for all members of society. Communism is
        the theory of a liberation which was not possible for the slaves, the
        serfs, or the handicraftsmen, but only for the proletarians and hence it
        belongs of necessity to the 19th century and was not possible in any
        earlier period. Question 14: Let m go back to the sixth question. As you
        wish to prepare for community of property by the enlightening and
        uniting of the proletariat, then you reject revolution? Answer: We are
        convinced not only of the uselessness but even of the harmfulness of all
        conspiracies. We are also aware that revolutions are not made
        deliberately and arbitrarily but that everywhere and at all times they
        are the necessary consequence of circumstances which are not in any way
        whatever dependent either on the will or on the leadership of individual
        parties or of whole classes. But we also see that the development of the
        proletariat in almost all countries of the world is forcibly repressed
        by the possessing classes and that thus a revolution is being forcibly
        worked for by the opponents of communism. If, in the end, the oppressed
        proletariat is thus driven into a revolution, then we will defend the
        cause of the proletariat just as well by our deeds as now by our words.
        Question 15: Do you intend to replace the existing social order by
        community of Property at one stroke? Answer: We have no such intention.
        The development of the masses cannot he ordered by decree. It is
        determined by the development of the conditions in which these masses
        live, and therefore proceeds gradually. Question 16: How do you think
        the transition from the present situation to community of Property is to
        be effected? Answer: The first, fundamental condition for the
        introduction of community of property is the political liberation of the
        proletariat through a democratic constitution. Question 17: What will be
        your first measure once you have established democracy? Answer:
        Guaranteeing the subsistence of the proletariat. Question 18: How will
        you do this? Answer. I. By limiting private property in such a way that
        it gradually prepares the way for its transformation into social
        property, e. g., by progressive taxation, limitation of the right of
        inheritance in favour of the state, etc., etc. II. By employing workers
        in national workshops and factories and on national estates. III. By
        educating all children at the expense of the state. Question 19: How
        will you arrange this kind of education during the period of transition?
        Answer: All children will be educated in state establishments from the
        time when they can do without the first maternal care. Question 20: Will
        not the introduction of community of property be accompanied by the
        proclamation of the community of women? Answer: By no means. We will
        only interfere in the personal relationship between men and women or
        with the family in general to the extent that the maintenance of the
        existing institution would disturb the new social order. Besides, we are
        well aware that the family relationship has been modified in the course
        of history by the property relationships and by periods of development,
        and that consequently the ending of private property will also have a
        most important influence on it. Question 21: Will nationalities continue
        to exist under communism? Answer: The nationalities of the peoples who
        join together according to the principle of community will be just as
        much compelled by this union to merge with one another and thereby
        supersede themselves as the various differences between estates and
        classes disappear through the superseding of their basis – private
        property. Question 22. Do Communists reject existing religions? Answer:
        All religions which have existed hitherto were expressions of historical
        stages of development of individual peoples or groups of peoples. But
        communism is that stage of historical development which makes all
        existing religions superfluous and supersedes them. In the name and on
        the mandate of the Congress. Secretary: Heide [Alias of Wilhelm Wolff in

        Works Peking, Foreign Languages Press, 1977, with editorial additions by
        marxists.org.]* In 1847 Engels wrote two draft programmes for the
        Communist League in the form of a catechism, one in June and the other
        in October. The latter, which is known as Principles of Communism, was
        first published in 1914. The earlier document “Draft of the Communist
        Confession of Faith”, was only found in 1968. It was first published in
        1969 in Hamburg, together with four other documents pertaining to the
        first congress of the Communist League, in a booklet entitled Gründungs
        Dokumente des Bundes der Kommunisten (Juni bis September 1847) [Founding
        Documents of the Communist League]. At the June 1847 Congress of the
        League of the Just, which was also the founding conference of the
        Communist League, it was decided to issue a draft “confession of faith”
        to be submitted for discussion to the sections of the League. The
        document which has now come to light is almost certainly this draft.
        Comparison of the two documents shows that Principles of Communism is a
        revised edition of this earlier draft. In Principles of Communism,
        Engels left three questions unanswered, in two cases with the notation
        “unchanged” (bleibt); this clearly refers to the answers provided in the
        earlier draft. The new draft for the programme was worked out by Engels
        on the instructions of the leading body of the Paris circle of the
        Communist League. The instructions were decided on after Engels’ sharp
        criticism at the committee meeting, on October 22, 1847, of the draft
        programme drawn up by the “true socialist“ Moses Hess, which was then
        rejected. Still considering Principles of Communism as a preliminary
        draft, Engels expressed the view, in a letter to Marx dated November
        23-24 1847, that it would be best to drop the old catechistic form and
        draw up a programme in the form of a manifesto. At the second congress
        of the Communist League (November 29-December 8, 1847) Marx and Engels
        defended the fundamental scientific principles of communism and were
        trusted with drafting a programme in the form of a manifesto of the
        Communist Party. In writing the manifesto the founders of Marxism made
        use of the propositions enunciated in Principles of Communism. Engels
        uses the term Manufaktur, and its derivatives, which have been
        translated “manufacture”, “manufacturing”, etc., Engels used this word
        literally, to indicate production by hand, not factory production for
        which Engels uses “big industry”. Manufaktur differs from handicraft
        (guild production in mediaeval towns), in that the latter was carried
        out by independent artisans. Manufacktur is carried out by homeworkers
        working for merchant capitalists, or by groups of craftspeople working
        together in large workshops owned by capitalists. It is therefore a
        transitional mode of production, between guild (handicraft) and modern
        (capitalist) forms of production. The Principles of Communism – 1 – What
        is Communism? Communism is the doctrine of the conditions of the
        liberation of the proletariat. – 2 – What is the proletariat? The
        proletariat is that class in society which lives entirely from the sale
        of its labor and does not draw profit from any kind of capital; whose
        weal and woe, whose life and death, whose sole existence depends on the
        demand for labor – hence, on the changing state of business, on the
        vagaries of unbridled competition. The proletariat, or the class of
        proletarians, is, in a word, the working class of the 19th century.[ In
        their works written in later periods, Marx and Engels substituted the
        more accurate concepts of “sale of labour power”, “value of labour
        power” and “price of labour power” (first introduced by Marx) for “sale
        of labour”, “value of labour” and “price of labour”, as used here.] – 3
        – Proletarians, then, have not always existed? No. There have always
        been poor and working classes; and the working class have mostly been
        poor. But there have not always been workers and poor people living
        under conditions as they are today; in other words, there have not
        always been proletarians, any more than there has always been free
        unbridled competitions. – 4 – How did the proletariat originate? The
        Proletariat originated in the industrial revolution, which took place in
        England in the last half of the last (18th) century, and which has since
        then been repeated in all the civilized countries of the world. This
        industrial revolution was precipitated by the discovery of the steam
        engine, various spinning machines, the mechanical loom, and a whole
        series of other mechanical devices. These machines, which were very
        expensive and hence could be bought only by big capitalists, altered the
        whole mode of production and displaced the former workers, because the
        machines turned out cheaper and better commodities than the workers
        could produce with their inefficient spinning wheels and handlooms. The
        machines delivered industry wholly into the hands of the big capitalists
        and rendered entirely worthless the meagre property of the workers
        (tools, looms, etc.). The result was that the capitalists soon had
        everything in their hands and nothing remained to the workers. This
        marked the introduction of the factory system into the textile industry.
        Once the impulse to the introduction of machinery and the factory system
        had been given, this system spread quickly to all other branches of
        industry, especially cloth- and book-printing, pottery, and the metal
        industries. Labor was more and more divided among the individual workers
        so that the worker who previously had done a complete piece of work now
        did only a part of that piece. This division of labor made it possible
        to produce things faster and cheaper. It reduced the activity of the
        individual worker to simple, endlessly repeated mechanical motions which
        could be performed not only as well but much better by a machine. In
        this way, all these industries fell, one after another, under the
        dominance of steam, machinery, and the factory system, just as spinning
        and weaving had already done. But at the same time, they also fell into
        the hands of big capitalists, and their workers were deprived of
        whatever independence remained to them. Gradually, not only genuine
        manufacture but also handicrafts came within the province of the factory
        system as big capitalists increasingly displaced the small master
        craftsmen by setting up huge workshops, which saved many expenses and
        permitted an elaborate division of labor. This is how it has come about
        that in civilized countries at the present time nearly all kinds of
        labor are performed in factories – and, in nearly all branches of work,
        handicrafts and manufacture have been superseded. This process has, to
        an ever greater degree, ruined the old middle class, especially the
        small handicraftsmen; it has entirely transformed the condition of the
        workers; and two new classes have been created which are gradually
        swallowing up all the others. These are: (i) The class of big
        capitalists, who, in all civilized countries, are already in almost
        exclusive possession of all the means of subsistence and of the
        instruments (machines, factories) and materials necessary for the
        production of the means of subsistence. This is the bourgeois class, or
        the bourgeoisie. (ii) The class of the wholly propertyless, who are
        obliged to sell their labor to the bourgeoisie in order to get, in
        exchange, the means of subsistence for their support. This is called the
        class of proletarians, or the proletariat. – 5 – Under what conditions
        does this sale of the labor of the proletarians to the bourgeoisie take
        place? Labor is a commodity, like any other, and its price is therefore
        determined by exactly the same laws that apply to other commodities. In
        a regime of big industry or of free competition – as we shall see, the
        two come to the same thing – the price of a commodity is, on the
        average, always equal to its cost of production. Hence, the price of
        labor is also equal to the cost of production of labor. But, the costs
        of production of labor consist of precisely the quantity of means of
        subsistence necessary to enable the worker to continue working, and to
        prevent the working class from dying out. The worker will therefore get
        no more for his labor than is necessary for this purpose; the price of
        labor, or the wage, will, in other words, be the lowest, the minimum,
        required for the maintenance of life. However, since business is
        sometimes better and sometimes worse, it follows that the worker
        sometimes gets more and sometimes gets less for his commodities. But,
        again, just as the industrialist, on the average of good times and bad,
        gets no more and no less for his commodities than what they cost,
        similarly on the average the worker gets no more and no less than his
        minimum. This economic law of wages operates the more strictly the
        greater the degree to which big industry has taken possession of all
        branches of production. – 6 – What working classes were there before the
        industrial revolution? The working classes have always, according to the
        different stages of development of society, lived in different
        circumstances and had different relations to the owning and ruling
        classes. In antiquity, the workers were the slaves of the owners, just
        as they still are in many backward countries and even in the southern
        part of the United States. In the Middle Ages, they were the serfs of
        the land-owning nobility, as they still are in Hungary, Poland, and
        Russia. In the Middle Ages, and indeed right up to the industrial
        revolution, there were also journeymen in the cities who worked in the
        service of petty bourgeois masters. Gradually, as manufacture developed,
        these journeymen became manufacturing workers who were even then
        employed by larger capitalists. – 7 – In what way do proletarians differ
        from slaves? The slave is sold once and for all; the proletarian must
        sell himself daily and hourly. The individual slave, property of one
        master, is assured an existence, however miserable it may be, because of
        the master’s interest. The individual proletarian, property as it were
        of the entire bourgeois class which buys his labor only when someone has
        need of it, has no secure existence. This existence is assured only to
        the class as a whole. The slave is outside competition; the proletarian
        is in it and experiences all its vagaries. The slave counts as a thing,
        not as a member of society. Thus, the slave can have a better existence
        than the proletarian, while the proletarian belongs to a higher stage of
        social development and, himself, stands on a higher social level than
        the slave. The slave frees himself when, of all the relations of private
        property, he abolishes only the relation of slavery and thereby becomes
        a proletarian; the proletarian can free himself only by abolishing
        private property in general. – 8 – In what way do proletarians differ
        from serfs? The serf possesses and uses an instrument of production, a
        piece of land, in exchange for which he gives up a part of his product
        or part of the services of his labor. The proletarian works with the
        instruments of production of another, for the account of this other, in
        exchange for a part of the product. The serf gives up, the proletarian
        receives. The serf has an assured existence, the proletarian has not.
        The serf is outside competition, the proletarian is in it. The serf
        liberates himself in one of three ways: either he runs away to the city
        and there becomes a handicraftsman; or, instead of products and
        services, he gives money to his lord and thereby becomes a free tenant;
        or he overthrows his feudal lord and himself becomes a property owner.
        In short, by one route or another, he gets into the owning class and
        enters into competition. The proletarian liberates himself by abolishing
        competition, private property, and all class differences. – 9 – In what
        way do proletarians differ from handicraftsmen? In contrast to the
        proletarian, the so-called handicraftsman, as he still existed almost
        everywhere in the past (eighteenth) century and still exists here and
        there at present, is a proletarian at most temporarily. His goal is to
        acquire capital himself wherewith to exploit other workers. He can often
        achieve this goal where guilds still exist or where freedom from guild
        restrictions has not yet led to the introduction of factory-style
        methods into the crafts nor yet to fierce competition But as soon as the
        factory system has been introduced into the crafts and competition
        flourishes fully, this perspective dwindles away and the handicraftsman
        becomes more and more a proletarian. The handicraftsman therefore frees
        himself by becoming either bourgeois or entering the middle class in
        general, or becoming a proletarian because of competition (as is now
        more often the case). In which case he can free himself by joining the
        proletarian movement, i.e., the more or less communist movement.[ Engels
        left half a page blank here in the manuscript. The “Draft of the
        Communist Confession of Faith,” has the answer shown for the same
        question (Number 12).] – 10 – In what way do proletarians differ from
        manufacturing workers? The manufacturing worker of the 16th to the 18th
        centuries still had, with but few exception, an instrument of production
        in his own possession – his loom, the family spinning wheel, a little
        plot of land which he cultivated in his spare time. The proletarian has
        none of these things. The manufacturing worker almost always lives in
        the countryside and in a more or less patriarchal relation to his
        landlord or employer; the proletarian lives, for the most part, in the
        city and his relation to his employer is purely a cash relation. The
        manufacturing worker is torn out of his patriarchal relation by big
        industry, loses whatever property he still has, and in this way becomes
        a proletarian. – 11 – What were the immediate consequences of the
        industrial revolution and of the division of society into bourgeoisie
        and proletariat? First, the lower and lower prices of industrial
        products brought about by machine labor totally destroyed, in all
        countries of the world, the old system of manufacture or industry based
        upon hand labor. In this way, all semi-barbarian countries, which had
        hitherto been more or less strangers to historical development, and
        whose industry had been based on manufacture, were violently forced out
        of their isolation. They bought the cheaper commodities of the English
        and allowed their own manufacturing workers to be ruined. Countries
        which had known no progress for thousands of years – for example, India
        – were thoroughly revolutionized, and even China is now on the way to a
        revolution. We have come to the point where a new machine invented in
        England deprives millions of Chinese workers of their livelihood within
        a year’s time. In this way, big industry has brought all the people of
        the Earth into contact with each other, has merged all local markets
        into one world market, has spread civilization and progress everywhere
        and has thus ensured that whatever happens in civilized countries will
        have repercussions in all other countries. It follows that if the
        workers in England or France now liberate themselves, this must set off
        revolution in all other countries – revolutions which, sooner or later,
        must accomplish the liberation of their respective working class.
        Second, wherever big industries displaced manufacture, the bourgeoisie
        developed in wealth and power to the utmost and made itself the first
        class of the country. The result was that wherever this happened, the
        bourgeoisie took political power into its own hands and displaced the
        hitherto ruling classes, the aristocracy, the guildmasters, and their
        representative, the absolute monarchy. The bourgeoisie annihilated the
        power of the aristocracy, the nobility, by abolishing the entailment of
        estates – in other words, by making landed property subject to purchase
        and sale, and by doing away with the special privileges of the nobility.
        It destroyed the power of the guildmasters by abolishing guilds and
        handicraft privileges. In their place, it put competition – that is, a
        state of society in which everyone has the right to enter into any
        branch of industry, the only obstacle being a lack of the necessary
        capital. The introduction of free competition is thus public declaration
        that from now on the members of society are unequal only to the extent
        that their capitals are unequal, that capital is the decisive power, and
        that therefore the capitalists, the bourgeoisie, have become the first
        class in society. Free competition is necessary for the establishment of
        big industry, because it is the only condition of society in which big
        industry can make its way. Having destroyed the social power of the
        nobility and the guildmasters, the bourgeois also destroyed their
        political power. Having raised itself to the actual position of first
        class in society, it proclaims itself to be also the dominant political
        class. This it does through the introduction of the representative
        system which rests on bourgeois equality before the law and the
        recognition of free competition, and in European countries takes the
        form of constitutional monarchy. In these constitutional monarchies,
        only those who possess a certain capital are voters – that is to say,
        only members of the bourgeoisie. These bourgeois voters choose the
        deputies, and these bourgeois deputies, by using their right to refuse
        to vote taxes, choose a bourgeois government. Third, everywhere the
        proletariat develops in step with the bourgeoisie. In proportion, as the
        bourgeoisie grows in wealth, the proletariat grows in numbers. For,
        since the proletarians can be employed only by capital, and since
        capital extends only through employing labor, it follows that the growth
        of the proletariat proceeds at precisely the same pace as the growth of
        capital. Simultaneously, this process draws members of the bourgeoisie
        and proletarians together into the great cities where industry can be
        carried on most profitably, and by thus throwing great masses in one
        spot it gives to the proletarians a consciousness of their own strength.
        Moreover, the further this process advances, the more new labor-saving
        machines are invented, the greater is the pressure exercised by big
        industry on wages, which, as we have seen, sink to their minimum and
        therewith render the condition of the proletariat increasingly
        unbearable. The growing dissatisfaction of the proletariat thus joins
        with its rising power to prepare a proletarian social revolution. – 12 –
        What were the further consequences of the industrial revolution? Big
        industry created in the steam engine, and other machines, the means of
        endlessly expanding industrial production, speeding it up, and cutting
        its costs. With production thus facilitated, the free competition, which
        is necessarily bound up with big industry, assumed the most extreme
        forms; a multitude of capitalists invaded industry, and, in a short
        while, more was produced than was needed. As a consequence, finished
        commodities could not be sold, and a so-called commercial crisis broke
        out. Factories had to be closed, their owners went bankrupt, and the
        workers were without bread. Deepest misery reigned everywhere. After a
        time, the superfluous products were sold, the factories began to operate
        again, wages rose, and gradually business got better than ever. But it
        was not long before too many commodities were again produced and a new
        crisis broke out, only to follow the same course as its predecessor.
        Ever since the beginning of this (19th) century, the condition of
        industry has constantly fluctuated between periods of prosperity and
        periods of crisis; nearly every five to seven years, a fresh crisis has
        intervened, always with the greatest hardship for workers, and always
        accompanied by general revolutionary stirrings and the direct peril to
        the whole existing order of things. – 13 – What follows from these
        periodic commercial crises? First: That, though big industry in its
        earliest stage created free competition, it has now outgrown free
        competition; that, for big industry, competition and generally the
        individualistic organization of production have become a fetter which it
        must and will shatter; that, so long as big industry remains on its
        present footing, it can be maintained only at the cost of general chaos
        every seven years, each time threatening the whole of civilization and
        not only plunging the proletarians into misery but also ruining large
        sections of the bourgeoisie; hence, either that big industry must itself
        be given up, which is an absolute impossibility, or that it makes
        unavoidably necessary an entirely new organization of society in which
        production is no longer directed by mutually competing individual
        industrialists but rather by the whole society operating according to a
        definite plan and taking account of the needs of all. Second: That big
        industry, and the limitless expansion of production which it makes
        possible, bring within the range of feasibility a social order in which
        so much is produced that every member of society will be in a position
        to exercise and develop all his powers and faculties in complete
        freedom. It thus appears that the very qualities of big industry which,
        in our present-day society, produce misery and crises are those which,
        in a different form of society, will abolish this misery and these
        catastrophic depressions. We see with the greatest clarity: (i) That all
        these evils are from now on to be ascribed solely to a social order
        which no longer corresponds to the requirements of the real situation;
        and (ii) That it is possible, through a new social order, to do away
        with these evils altogether. – 14 – What will this new social order have
        to be like? Above all, it will have to take the control of industry and
        of all branches of production out of the hands of mutually competing
        individuals, and instead institute a system in which all these branches
        of production are operated by society as a whole – that is, for the
        common account, according to a common plan, and with the participation
        of all members of society. It will, in other words, abolish competition
        and replace it with association. Moreover, since the management of
        industry by individuals necessarily implies private property, and since
        competition is in reality merely the manner and form in which the
        control of industry by private property owners expresses itself, it
        follows that private property cannot be separated from competition and
        the individual management of industry. Private property must, therefore,
        be abolished and in its place must come the common utilization of all
        instruments of production and the distribution of all products according
        to common agreement – in a word, what is called the communal ownership
        of goods. In fact, the abolition of private property is, doubtless, the
        shortest and most significant way to characterize the revolution in the
        whole social order which has been made necessary by the development of
        industry – and for this reason it is rightly advanced by communists as
        their main demand. – 15 – Was not the abolition of private property
        possible at an earlier time? No. Every change in the social order, every
        revolution in property relations, is the necessary consequence of the
        creation of new forces of production which no longer fit into the old
        property relations. Private property has not always existed. When,
        towards the end of the Middle Ages, there arose a new mode of production
        which could not be carried on under the then existing feudal and guild
        forms of property, this manufacture, which had outgrown the old property
        relations, created a new property form, private property. And for
        manufacture and the earliest stage of development of big industry,
        private property was the only possible property form; the social order
        based on it was the only possible social order. So long as it is not
        possible to produce so much that there is enough for all, with more left
        over for expanding the social capital and extending the forces of
        production – so long as this is not possible, there must always be a
        ruling class directing the use of society’s productive forces, and a
        poor, oppressed class. How these classes are constituted depends on the
        stage of development. The agrarian Middle Ages give us the baron and the
        serf; the cities of the later Middle Ages show us the guildmaster and
        the journeyman and the day laborer; the 17th century has its
        manufacturing workers; the 19th has big factory owners and proletarians.
        It is clear that, up to now, the forces of production have never been
        developed to the point where enough could be developed for all, and that
        private property has become a fetter and a barrier in relation to the
        further development of the forces of production. Now, however, the
        development of big industry has ushered in a new period. Capital and the
        forces of production have been expanded to an unprecedented extent, and
        the means are at hand to multiply them without limit in the near future.
        Moreover, the forces of production have been concentrated in the hands
        of a few bourgeois, while the great mass of the people are more and more
        falling into the proletariat, their situation becoming more wretched and
        intolerable in proportion to the increase of wealth of the bourgeoisie.
        And finally, these mighty and easily extended forces of production have
        so far outgrown private property and the bourgeoisie, that they threaten
        at any moment to unleash the most violent disturbances of the social
        order. Now, under these conditions, the abolition of private property
        has become not only possible but absolutely necessary. – 16 – Will the
        peaceful abolition of private property be possible? It would be
        desirable if this could happen, and the communists would certainly be
        the last to oppose it. Communists know only too well that all
        conspiracies are not only useless, but even harmful. They know all too
        well that revolutions are not made intentionally and arbitrarily, but
        that, everywhere and always, they have been the necessary consequence of
        conditions which were wholly independent of the will and direction of
        individual parties and entire classes. But they also see that the
        development of the proletariat in nearly all civilized countries has
        been violently suppressed, and that in this way the opponents of
        communism have been working toward a revolution with all their strength.
        If the oppressed proletariat is finally driven to revolution, then we
        communists will defend the interests of the proletarians with deeds as
        we now defend them with words. – 17 – Will it be possible for private
        property to be abolished at one stroke? No, no more than existing forces
        of production can at one stroke be multiplied to the extent necessary
        for the creation of a communal society. In all probability, the
        proletarian revolution will transform existing society gradually and
        will be able to abolish private property only when the means of
        production are available in sufficient quantity. – 18 – What will be the
        course of this revolution? Above all, it will establish a democratic
        constitution, and through this, the direct or indirect dominance of the
        proletariat. Direct in England, where the proletarians are already a
        majority of the people. Indirect in France and Germany, where the
        majority of the people consists not only of proletarians, but also of
        small peasants and petty bourgeois who are in the process of falling
        into the proletariat, who are more and more dependent in all their
        political interests on the proletariat, and who must, therefore, soon
        adapt to the demands of the proletariat. Perhaps this will cost a second
        struggle, but the outcome can only be the victory of the proletariat.
        Democracy would be wholly valueless to the proletariat if it were not
        immediately used as a means for putting through measures directed
        against private property and ensuring the livelihood of the proletariat.
        The main measures, emerging as the necessary result of existing
        relations, are the following: (i) Limitation of private property through
        progressive taxation, heavy inheritance taxes, abolition of inheritance
        through collateral lines (brothers, nephews, etc.) forced loans, etc.
        (ii) Gradual expropriation of landowners, industrialists, railroad
        magnates and shipowners, partly through competition by state industry,
        partly directly through compensation in the form of bonds. (iii)
        Confiscation of the possessions of all emigrants and rebels against the
        majority of the people. (iv) Organization of labor or employment of
        proletarians on publicly owned land, in factories and workshops, with
        competition among the workers being abolished and with the factory
        owners, in so far as they still exist, being obliged to pay the same
        high wages as those paid by the state. (v) An equal obligation on all
        members of society to work until such time as private property has been
        completely abolished. Formation of industrial armies, especially for
        agriculture. (vi) Centralization of money and credit in the hands of the
        state through a national bank with state capital, and the suppression of
        all private banks and bankers. (vii) Increase in the number of national
        factories, workshops, railroads, ships; bringing new lands into
        cultivation and improvement of land already under cultivation – all in
        proportion to the growth of the capital and labor force at the disposal
        of the nation. (viii) Education of all children, from the moment they
        can leave their mother’s care, in national establishments at national
        cost. Education and production together. (ix) Construction, on public
        lands, of great palaces as communal dwellings for associated groups of
        citizens engaged in both industry and agriculture and combining in their
        way of life the advantages of urban and rural conditions while avoiding
        the one-sidedness and drawbacks of each. (x) Destruction of all
        unhealthy and jerry-built dwellings in urban districts. (xi) Equal
        inheritance rights for children born in and out of wedlock. (xii)
        Concentration of all means of transportation in the hands of the nation.
        It is impossible, of course, to carry out all these measures at once.
        But one will always bring others in its wake. Once the first radical
        attack on private property has been launched, the proletariat will find
        itself forced to go ever further, to concentrate increasingly in the
        hands of the state all capital, all agriculture, all transport, all
        trade. All the foregoing measures are directed to this end; and they
        will become practicable and feasible, capable of producing their
        centralizing effects to precisely the degree that the proletariat,
        through its labor, multiplies the country’s productive forces. Finally,
        when all capital, all production, all exchange have been brought
        together in the hands of the nation, private property will disappear of
        its own accord, money will become superfluous, and production will so
        expand and man so change that society will be able to slough off
        whatever of its old economic habits may remain. – 19 – Will it be
        possible for this revolution to take place in one country alone? No. By
        creating the world market, big industry has already brought all the
        peoples of the Earth, and especially the civilized peoples, into such
        close relation with one another that none is independent of what happens
        to the others. Further, it has co-ordinated the social development of
        the civilized countries to such an extent that, in all of them,
        bourgeoisie and proletariat have become the decisive classes, and the
        struggle between them the great struggle of the day. It follows that the
        communist revolution will not merely be a national phenomenon but must
        take place simultaneously in all civilized countries – that is to say,
        at least in England, America, France, and Germany. It will develop in
        each of the these countries more or less rapidly, according as one
        country or the other has a more developed industry, greater wealth, a
        more significant mass of productive forces. Hence, it will go slowest
        and will meet most obstacles in Germany, most rapidly and with the
        fewest difficulties in England. It will have a powerful impact on the
        other countries of the world, and will radically alter the course of
        development which they have followed up to now, while greatly stepping
        up its pace. It is a universal revolution and will, accordingly, have a
        universal range. – 20 – What will be the consequences of the ultimate
        disappearance of private property? Society will take all forces of
        production and means of commerce, as well as the exchange and
        distribution of products, out of the hands of private capitalists and
        will manage them in accordance with a plan based on the availability of
        resources and the needs of the whole society. In this way, most
        important of all, the evil consequences which are now associated with
        the conduct of big industry will be abolished. There will be no more
        crises; the expanded production, which for the present order of society
        is overproduction and hence a prevailing cause of misery, will then be
        insufficient and in need of being expanded much further. Instead of
        generating misery, overproduction will reach beyond the elementary
        requirements of society to assure the satisfaction of the needs of all;
        it will create new needs and, at the same time, the means of satisfying
        them. It will become the condition of, and the stimulus to, new
        progress, which will no longer throw the whole social order into
        confusion, as progress has always done in the past. Big industry, freed
        from the pressure of private property, will undergo such an expansion
        that what we now see will seem as petty in comparison as manufacture
        seems when put beside the big industry of our own day. This development
        of industry will make available to society a sufficient mass of products
        to satisfy the needs of everyone. The same will be true of agriculture,
        which also suffers from the pressure of private property and is held
        back by the division of privately owned land into small parcels. Here,
        existing improvements and scientific procedures will be put into
        practice, with a resulting leap forward which will assure to society all
        the products it needs. In this way, such an abundance of goods will be
        able to satisfy the needs of all its members. The division of society
        into different, mutually hostile classes will then become unnecessary.
        Indeed, it will be not only unnecessary but intolerable in the new
        social order. The existence of classes originated in the division of
        labor, and the division of labor, as it has been known up to the
        present, will completely disappear. For mechanical and chemical
        processes are not enough to bring industrial and agricultural production
        up to the level we have described; the capacities of the men who make
        use of these processes must undergo a corresponding development. Just as
        the peasants and manufacturing workers of the last century changed their
        whole way of life and became quite different people when they were drawn
        into big industry, in the same way, communal control over production by
        society as a whole, and the resulting new development, will both require
        an entirely different kind of human material. People will no longer be,
        as they are today, subordinated to a single branch of production, bound
        to it, exploited by it; they will no longer develop one of their
        faculties at the expense of all others; they will no longer know only
        one branch, or one branch of a single branch, of production as a whole.
        Even industry as it is today is finding such people less and less
        useful. Industry controlled by society as a whole, and operated
        according to a plan, presupposes well-rounded human beings, their
        faculties developed in balanced fashion, able to see the system of
        production in its entirety. The form of the division of labor which
        makes one a peasant, another a cobbler, a third a factory worker, a
        fourth a stock-market operator, has already been undermined by machinery
        and will completely disappear. Education will enable young people
        quickly to familiarize themselves with the whole system of production
        and to pass from one branch of production to another in response to the
        needs of society or their own inclinations. It will, therefore, free
        them from the one-sided character which the present-day division of
        labor impresses upon every individual. Communist society will, in this
        way, make it possible for its members to put their comprehensively
        developed faculties to full use. But, when this happens, classes will
        necessarily disappear. It follows that society organized on a communist
        basis is incompatible with the existence of classes on the one hand, and
        that the very building of such a society provides the means of
        abolishing class differences on the other. A corollary of this is that
        the difference between city and country is destined to disappear. The
        management of agriculture and industry by the same people rather than by
        two different classes of people is, if only for purely material reasons,
        a necessary condition of communist association. The dispersal of the
        agricultural population on the land, alongside the crowding of the
        industrial population into the great cities, is a condition which
        corresponds to an undeveloped state of both agriculture and industry and
        can already be felt as an obstacle to further development. The general
        co-operation of all members of society for the purpose of planned
        exploitation of the forces of production, the expansion of production to
        the point where it will satisfy the needs of all, the abolition of a
        situation in which the needs of some are satisfied at the expense of the
        needs of others, the complete liquidation of classes and their
        conflicts, the rounded development of the capacities of all members of
        society through the elimination of the present division of labor,
        through industrial education, through engaging in varying activities,
        through the participation by all in the enjoyments produced by all,
        through the combination of city and country – these are the main
        consequences of the abolition of private property. – 21 – What will be
        the influence of communist society on the family? It will transform the
        relations between the sexes into a purely private matter which concerns
        only the persons involved and into which society has no occasion to
        intervene. It can do this since it does away with private property and
        educates children on a communal basis, and in this way removes the two
        bases of traditional marriage – the dependence rooted in private
        property, of the women on the man, and of the children on the parents.
        And here is the answer to the outcry of the highly moral philistines
        against the “community of women”. Community of women is a condition
        which belongs entirely to bourgeois society and which today finds its
        complete expression in prostitution. But prostitution is based on
        private property and falls with it. Thus, communist society, instead of
        introducing community of women, in fact abolishes it. – 22 – What will
        be the attitude of communism to existing nationalities? The
        nationalities of the peoples associating themselves in accordance with
        the principle of community will be compelled to mingle with each other
        as a result of this association and thereby to dissolve themselves, just
        as the various estate and class distinctions must disappear through the
        abolition of their basis, private property.[ Engels’ put “unchanged”
        here, referring to the answer in the June draft under No. 21 as shown.]
        – 23 – What will be its attitude to existing religions? All religions so
        far have been the expression of historical stages of development of
        individual peoples or groups of peoples. But communism is the stage of
        historical development which makes all existing religions superfluous
        and brings about their disappearance.[ Similarly, this refers to the
        answer to Question 23 in the June draft.] – 24 – How do communists
        differ from socialists? The so-called socialists are divided into three
        categories. [ Reactionary Socialists: ] The first category consists of
        adherents of a feudal and patriarchal society which has already been
        destroyed, and is still daily being destroyed, by big industry and world
        trade and their creation, bourgeois society. This category concludes,
        from the evils of existing society, that feudal and patriarchal society
        must be restored because it was free of such evils. In one way or
        another, all their proposals are directed to this end. This category of
        reactionary socialists, for all their seeming partisanship and their
        scalding tears for the misery of the proletariat, is nevertheless
        energetically opposed by the communists for the following reasons: (i)
        It strives for something which is entirely impossible. (ii) It seeks to
        establish the rule of the aristocracy, the guildmasters, the small
        producers, and their retinue of absolute or feudal monarchs, officials,
        soldiers, and priests – a society which was, to be sure, free of the
        evils of present-day society but which brought it at least as many evils
        without even offering to the oppressed workers the prospect of
        liberation through a communist revolution. (iii) As soon as the
        proletariat becomes revolutionary and communist, these reactionary
        socialists show their true colors by immediately making common cause
        with the bourgeoisie against the proletarians. [ Bourgeois Socialists: ]
        The second category consists of adherents of present-day society who
        have been frightened for its future by the evils to which it necessarily
        gives rise. What they want, therefore, is to maintain this society while
        getting rid of the evils which are an inherent part of it. To this end,
        some propose mere welfare measures – while others come forward with
        grandiose systems of reform which, under the pretense of re-organizing
        society, are in fact intended to preserve the foundations, and hence the
        life, of existing society. Communists must unremittingly struggle
        against these bourgeois socialists because they work for the enemies of
        communists and protect the society which communists aim to overthrow. [
        Democratic Socialists: ] Finally, the third category consists of
        democratic socialists who favor some of the same measures the communists
        advocate, as described in Question 18, not as part of the transition to
        communism, however, but as measures which they believe will be
        sufficient to abolish the misery and evils of present-day society. These
        democratic socialists are either proletarians who are not yet
        sufficiently clear about the conditions of the liberation of their
        class, or they are representatives of the petty bourgeoisie, a class
        which, prior to the achievement of democracy and the socialist measures
        to which it gives rise, has many interests in common with the
        proletariat. It follows that, in moments of action, the communists will
        have to come to an understanding with these democratic socialists, and
        in general to follow as far as possible a common policy with them –
        provided that these socialists do not enter into the service of the
        ruling bourgeoisie and attack the communists. It is clear that this form
        of co-operation in action does not exclude the discussion of
        differences. – 25 – What is the attitude of the communists to the other
        political parties of our time? This attitude is different in the
        different countries. In England, France, and Belgium, where the
        bourgeoisie rules, the communists still have a common interest with the
        various democratic parties, an interest which is all the greater the
        more closely the socialistic measures they champion approach the aims of
        the communists – that is, the more clearly and definitely they represent
        the interests of the proletariat and the more they depend on the
        proletariat for support. In England, for example, the working-class
        Chartists[ The Chartists were the participants in the political movement
        of the British workers which lasted from the 1830s to the middle 1850s
        and had as its slogan the adoption of a People’s Charter, demanding
        universal franchise and a series of conditions guaranteeing voting
        rights for all workers. Lenin defined Chartism as the world’s “first
        broad, truly mass and politically organized proletarian revolutionary
        movement” (Collected Works, Eng. ed., Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1965,
        Vol. 29, p. 309.) The decline of the Chartist movement was due to the
        strengthening of Britain’s industrial and commercial monopoly and the
        bribing of the upper stratum of the working class (“the labour
        aristocracy”) by the British bourgeoisie out of its super-profits. Both
        factors led to the strengthening of opportunist tendencies in this
        stratum as expressed, in particular, by the refusal of the trade union
        leaders to support Chartism. ] are infinitely closer to the communists
        than the democratic petty bourgeoisie or the so-called Radicals. In
        America, where a democratic constitution has already been established,
        the communists must make the common cause with the party which will turn
        this constitution against the bourgeoisie and use it in the interests of
        the proletariat – that is, with the agrarian National Reformers.[
        Probably a references to the National Reform Association, founded during
        the 1840s by George H. Evans, with headquarters in New York City, which
        had for its motto, “Vote Yourself a Farm”.] In Switzerland, the
        Radicals, though a very mixed party, are the only group with which the
        communists can co-operate, and, among these Radicals, the Vaudois and
        Genevese are the most advanced. In Germany, finally, the decisive
        struggle now on the order of the day is that between the bourgeoisie and
        the absolute monarchy. Since the communists cannot enter upon the
        decisive struggle between themselves and the bourgeoisie until the
        bourgeoisie is in power, it follows that it is in the interest of the
        communists to help the bourgeoisie to power as soon as possible in order
        the sooner to be able to overthrow it. Against the governments,
        therefore, the communists must continually support the radical liberal
        party, taking care to avoid the self-deceptions of the bourgeoisie and
        not fall for the enticing promises of benefits which a victory for the
        bourgeoisie would allegedly bring to the proletariat. The sole
        advantages which the proletariat would derive from a bourgeois victory
        would consist (i) in various concessions which would facilitate the
        unification of the proletariat into a closely knit, battle-worthy, and
        organized class; and (ii) in the certainly that, on the very day the
        absolute monarchies fall, the struggle between bourgeoisie and
        proletariat will start. From that day on, the policy of the communists
        will be the same as it now is in the countries where the bourgeoisie is
        already in power. Demands of the Communist Party in Germany “Demands of
        the Communist Party in Germany” were written by Karl Marx and Frederick
        Engels in Paris between March 21 (when Engels arrived in Paris from
        Brussels) and March 24, 1848. This document was discussed by members of
        the Central Authority, who approved and signed it as the. political
        programme of the Communist League in the revolution that broke out in
        Germany. In March it was printed as a leaflet, for distribution among
        revolutionary German emigrant workers who were about to return home.
        Austrian and German diplomats in Paris informed their respective
        governments about this as early as March 27, 28 and 29. (The Austrian
        Ambassador enclosed in his letter a copy of the leaflet which he dated
        “March 25”.) The leaflet soon reached members of the Communist League in
        other countries, in particular, German emigrant workers in London. Early
        in April, the “Demands of the Communist Party in Germany” were published
        in such German democratic papers as Berliner Zeitungs-Halle (special
        supplement to No. 82, April 5, 1848), Düsseldorfer Zeitung (No. 96,
        April 5, 1848), Mannheimer Abendzeitung (No. 96, April 6, 1848),
        Trier’sche Zeitung (No. 97, April 6, 1848, supplement), Deutsche
        Allgemeine Zeitung (No. 100, April 9, 1848, supplement), and Zeitung für
        das deutsche Volk (No. 2 1, April 9, 1848). Marx and Engels, who left
        for Germany round about April 6 and some time later settled in Cologne,
        did their best along with their followers to popularise this programme
        document during the revolution. In 1848 and 1849 it was repeatedly
        published in the periodical press and in leaflet form. Not later than
        September 10, 1848, the “Demands” were printed in Cologne as a leaflet
        for circulation by the Cologne Workers’ Association both in the town
        itself and in a number of districts of Rhenish Prussia. In addition to
        minor stylistic changes, point 10 in the text of the leaflet was worded
        differently from that published in March-April 1848. At the Second
        Democratic Congress held in Berlin in October 1848, Friedrich Beust,
        delegate from the Cologne Workers’ Association, spoke, on behalf of the
        social question commission, in favour of adopting a programme of action
        closely following the “Demands”. In November and December 1848, various
        points of the “Demands” were discussed at meetings of the Cologne
        Workers’ Association. Many editions of the “Demands” published during
        the revolution and after its defeat have survived to this day in their
        original form, some of them as copies kept in the police archives. At
        the end of 1848 or the beginning of 1849 an abridged version of the
        “Demands” was published in pamphlet form by Weller Publishers in
        Leipzig. The slogan at the beginning of the document, the second
        paragraph of point 9 and the last sentence of point 10 were omitted, and
        the words “The Committee” were not included among the signatories. In
        1853, an abridged version of the “Demands” was printed, together with
        other documents of the Communist League, in the first part of the book
        Die Communisten-Verschworungen des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts published in
        Berlin for purposes of information by Wermuth and Stieber, two police
        officials, who staged a trial against the Communists in Cologne in 1852.
        Later Engels reproduced the main points of the “Demands” in his essay On
        the History of the Communist League, published in November 1885 in the
        newspaper Sozialdemokrat, and as an introduction to the pamphlet: K.
        Marx, Enthüllungen über den Kommunisten Prozess zu Köln,
        Hottingen-Zürich, 1885. English translations of the “Demands of the
        Communist Party in Germany” appeared in the collections: The Communist
        Manifesto of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels with an introduction and
        explanatory notes by D. Ryazanoff, Martin Lawrence, London (1930); K.

        Communist Party in Germany “Workers of all countries, unite!” 1. The
        whole of Germany shall be declared a single and indivisible republic. 2.
        Every German, having reached the age of 21, shall have the right to vote
        and to be elected, provided he has not been convicted of a criminal
        offence. 3. Representatives of the people shall receive payment so that
        workers, too, shall be able to become members of the German parliament.
        4. Universal arming of the people. In future the armies shall be
        simultaneously labour armies, so that the troops shall not, as formerly,
        merely consume, but shall produce more than is necessary for their
        upkeep. This will moreover be conducive to the organisation of labour.
        5. Legal services shall be free of charge. 6. All feudal obligations,
        dues, corvées, tithes etc., which have hitherto weighed upon the rural
        population, shall be abolished without compensation. 7. Princely and
        other feudal estates, together with mines, pits, and so forth, shall
        become the property of the state. The estates shall be cultivated on a
        large scale and with the most up-to-date scientific devices in the
        interests of the whole of society. 8. Mortgages on peasant lands shall
        be declared the property of the state. Interest on such mortgages shall
        be paid by the peasants to the state. 9. In localities where the tenant
        system is developed, the land rent or the quit-rent shall be paid to the
        state as a tax. The measures specified in Nos. 6, 7, 8 and 9 are to be
        adopted in order to reduce the communal and other burdens hitherto
        imposed upon the peasants and small tenant farmers without curtailing
        the means available for defraying state expenses and without imperilling
        production. The landowner in the strict sense, who is neither a peasant
        nor a tenant farmer, has no share in production. Consumption on his part
        is, therefore, nothing but abuse. 10. A state bank, whose paper issues
        are legal tender, shall replace all private banks. This measure will
        make it possible to regulate the credit system in the interest of the
        people as a whole, and will thus undermine the dominion of the big
        financial magnates. Further, by gradually substituting paper money for
        gold and silver coin, the universal means of exchange (that
        indispensable prerequisite of bourgeois trade and commerce) will be
        cheapened, and gold and silver will be set free for use in foreign
        trade. Finally, this measure is necessary in order to bind the interests
        of the conservative bourgeoisie to the Government. 11. All the means of
        transport, railways, canals, steamships, roads, the posts etc. shall be
        taken over by the state. They shall become the property of the state and
        shall be placed free at the disposal of the impecunious classes. 12. All
        civil servants shall receive the same salary, the only exception being
        that civil servants who have a family to support and who therefore have
        greater requirements, shall receive a higher salary. 13. Complete
        separation of Church and State. The clergy of every denomination shall
        be paid only by the voluntary contributions of their congregations. 14.
        The right of inheritance to be curtailed. 15. The introduction of
        steeply graduated taxes, and the abolition of taxes on articles of
        consumption. 16. Inauguration of national workshops. The state
        guarantees a livelihood to all workers and provides for those who are
        incapacitated for work. 17. Universal and free education of the people.
        It is to the interest of the German proletariat, the petty bourgeoisie
        and the small peasants to support these demands with all possible
        energy. Only by the realisation of these demands will the millions in
        Germany, who have hitherto been exploited by a handful of persons and
        whom the exploiters would like to keep in further subjection, win the
        rights and attain to that power to which they are entitled as the
        producers of all wealth. The Committee Karl Marx, Karl Schapper, H.
        Bauer, F. Engels, J. Moll, W. Wolff The Paris Commune. Address to the
        International Workingmen’s Association, May 1871 The “Paris Commune” was
        composed by Karl Marx as an address to the General Council of the
        International, and included in a book, “The Civil War in France,” with
        the aim of distributing to workers of all countries a clear
        understanding of the character and world-wide significance of the heroic
        struggle of the Communards and their historical experience to learn
        from. The book was widely circulated by 1872 it was translated into
        several languages and published throughout Europe and the United States.
        The first address was delivered on July 23rd, 1870, five days after the
        beginning of the Franco-Prussian War. The second address, delivered on
        September 9, 1870, gave a historical overview of the events a week after
        the army of Bonaparte was defeated. The third address, delivered on May
        30, 1871, two days after the defeat of the Paris Commune – detailed the
        significance and the underlining causes of the first workers government
        ever created. The Civil War in France was originally published by Marx
        as only the third address, only the first half of which is reproduced
        here. In 1891, on the 20th anniversary of the Paris Commune, Engels put
        together a new collection of the work. Engels decided to include the
        first two addresses that Marx made to the International. The Address is
        included here because it can be regarded as an amendment to the
        Manifesto, clarifying a number of issues relating to the state based on
        the experience of the Commune. On the dawn of March 18, Paris arose to
        the thunder-burst of “Vive la Commune!” What is the Commune, that sphinx
        so tantalizing to the bourgeois mind? “The proletarians of Paris,” said
        the Central Committee in its manifesto of March 18, “amidst the failures
        and treasons of the ruling classes, have understood that the hour has
        struck for them to save the situation by taking into their own hands the
        direction of public affairs.... They have understood that it is their
        imperious duty, and their absolute right, to render themselves masters
        of their own destinies, by seizing upon the governmental power.” But the
        working class cannot simply lay hold of the ready-made state machinery,
        and wield it for its own purposes. The centralized state power, with its
        ubiquitous organs of standing army, police, bureaucracy, clergy, and
        judicature – organs wrought after the plan of a systematic and
        hierarchic division of labor – originates from the days of absolute
        monarchy, serving nascent bourgeois society as a mighty weapon in its
        struggle against feudalism. Still, its development remained clogged by
        all manner of medieval rubbish, seignorial rights, local privileges,
        municipal and guild monopolies, and provincial constitutions. The
        gigantic broom of the French Revolution of the 18th century swept away
        all these relics of bygone times, thus clearing simultaneously the
        social soil of its last hindrances to the superstructure of the modern
        state edifice raised under the First Empire, itself the offspring of the
        coalition wars of old semi-feudal Europe against modern France. During
        the subsequent regimes, the government, placed under parliamentary
        control – that is, under the direct control of the propertied classes –
        became not only a hotbed of huge national debts and crushing taxes; with
        its irresistible allurements of place, pelf, and patronage, it became
        not only the bone of contention between the rival factions and
        adventurers of the ruling classes; but its political character changed
        simultaneously with the economic changes of society. At the same pace at
        which the progress of modern industry developed, widened, intensified
        the class antagonism between capital and labor, the state power assumed
        more and more the character of the national power of capital over labor,
        of a public force organized for social enslavement, of an engine of
        class despotism. After every revolution marking a progressive phase in
        the class struggle, the purely repressive character of the state power
        stands out in bolder and bolder relief. The Revolution of 1830,
        resulting in the transfer of government from the landlords to the
        capitalists, transferred it from the more remote to the more direct
        antagonists of the working men. The bourgeois republicans, who, in the
        name of the February Revolution, took the state power, used it for the
        June [1848] massacres, in order to convince the working class that
        “social” republic means the republic entrusting their social subjection,
        and in order to convince the royalist bulk of the bourgeois and landlord
        class that they might safely leave the cares and emoluments of
        government to the bourgeois “republicans.” However, after their one
        heroic exploit of June, the bourgeois republicans had, from the front,
        to fall back to the rear of the “Party of Order” – a combination formed
        by all the rival fractions and factions of the appropriating classes.
        The proper form of their joint-stock government was the parliamentary
        republic, with Louis Bonaparte for its president. Theirs was a regime of
        avowed class terrorism and deliberate insult towards the “vile
        multitude.” If the parliamentary republic, as M. Thiers said, “divided
        them [the different fractions of the ruling class] least,” it opened an
        abyss between that class and the whole body of society outside their
        spare ranks. The restraints by which their own divisions had under
        former regimes still checked the state power, were removed by their
        union; and in view of the threatening upheaval of the proletariat, they
        now used that state power mercilessly and ostentatiously as the national
        war engine of capital against labor. In their uninterrupted crusade
        against the producing masses, they were, however, bound not only to
        invest the executive with continually increased powers of repression,
        but at the same time to divest their own parliamentary stronghold – the
        National Assembly – one by one, of all its own means of defence against
        the Executive. The Executive, in the person of Louis Bonaparte, turned
        them out. The natural offspring of the “Party of Order” republic was the
        Second Empire. The empire, with the coup d’état for its birth
        certificate, universal suffrage for its sanction, and the sword for its
        sceptre, professed to rest upon the peasantry, the large mass of
        producers not directly involved in the struggle of capital and labor. It
        professed to save the working class by breaking down parliamentarism,
        and, with it, the undisguised subserviency of government to the
        propertied classes. It professed to save the propertied classes by
        upholding their economic supremacy over the working class; and, finally,
        it professed to unite all classes by reviving for all the chimera of
        national glory. In reality, it was the only form of government possible
        at a time when the bourgeoisie had already lost, and the working class
        had not yet acquired, the faculty of ruling the nation. It was acclaimed
        throughout the world as the savior of society. Under its sway, bourgeois
        society, freed from political cares, attained a development unexpected
        even by itself. Its industry and commerce expanded to colossal
        dimensions; financial swindling celebrated cosmopolitan orgies; the
        misery of the masses was set off by a shameless display of gorgeous,
        meretricious and debased luxury. The state power, apparently soaring
        high above society and the very hotbed of all its corruptions. Its own
        rottenness, and the rottenness of the society it had saved, were laid
        bare by the bayonet of Prussia, herself eagerly bent upon transferring
        the supreme seat of that regime from Paris to Berlin. Imperialism is, at
        the same time, the most prostitute and the ultimate form of the state
        power which nascent bourgeois society had commenced to elaborate as a
        means of its own emancipation from feudalism, and which full-grown
        bourgeois society had finally transformed into a means for the
        enslavement of labor by capital. The direct antithesis to the empire was
        the Commune. The cry of “social republic,” with which the February
        [1848] Revolution was ushered in by the Paris proletariat, did but
        express a vague aspiration after a republic that was not only to
        supercede the monarchical form of class rule, but class rule itself. The
        Commune was the positive form of that republic. Paris, the central seat
        of the old governmental power, and, at the same time, the social
        stronghold of the French working class, had risen in arms against the
        attempt of Thiers and the Rurals to restore and perpetuate that old
        governmental power bequeathed to them by the empire. Paris could resist
        only because, in consequence of the siege, it had got rid of the army,
        and replaced it by a National Guard, the bulk of which consisted of
        working men. This fact was now to be transformed into an institution.
        The first decree of the Commune, therefore, was the suppression of the
        standing army, and the substitution for it of the armed people. The
        Commune was formed of the municipal councillors, chosen by universal
        suffrage in the various wards of the town, responsible and revocable at
        short terms. The majority of its members were naturally working men, or
        acknowledged representatives of the working class. The Commune was to be
        a working, not a parliamentary body, executive and legislative at the
        same time. Instead of continuing to be the agent of the Central
        Government, the police was at once stripped of its political attributes,
        and turned into the responsible, and at all times revocable, agent of
        the Commune. So were the officials of all other branches of the
        administration. From the members of the Commune downwards, the public
        service had to be done at workman’s wage. The vested interests and the
        representation allowances of the high dignitaries of state disappeared
        along with the high dignitaries themselves. Public functions ceased to
        be the private property of the tools of the Central Government. Not only
        municipal administration, but the whole initiative hitherto exercised by
        the state was laid into the hands of the Commune. Having once got rid of
        the standing army and the police – the physical force elements of the
        old government – the Commune was anxious to break the spiritual force of
        repression, the “parson-power,” by the disestablishment and disendowment
        of all churches as proprietary bodies. The priests were sent back to the
        recesses of private life, there to feed upon the alms of the faithful in
        imitation of their predecessors, the apostles. The whole of the
        educational institutions were opened to the people gratuitously, and at
        the same time cleared of all interference of church and state. Thus, not
        only was education made accessible to all, but science itself freed from
        the fetters which class prejudice and governmental force had imposed
        upon it. The judicial functionaries were to be divested of that sham
        independence which had but served to mask their abject subserviency to
        all succeeding governments to which, in turn, they had taken, and
        broken, the oaths of allegiance. Like the rest of public servants,
        magistrates and judges were to be elective, responsible, and revocable.
        The Paris Commune was, of course, to serve as a model to all the great
        industrial centres of France. The communal regime once established in
        Paris and the secondary centres, the old centralized government would in
        the provinces, too, have to give way to the self-government of the
        producers. In a rough sketch of national organisation, which the Commune
        had no time to develop, it states clearly that the Commune was to be the
        political form of even the smallest country hamlet, and that in the
        rural districts the standing army was to be replaced by a national
        militia, with an extremely short term of service. The rural communities
        of every district were to administer their common affairs by an assembly
        of delegates in the central town, and these district assemblies were
        again to send deputies to the National Delegation in Paris, each
        delegate to be at any time revocable and bound by the mandat imperatif
        (formal instructions) of his constituents. The few but important
        functions which would still remain for a central government were not to
        be suppressed, as has been intentionally misstated, but were to be
        discharged by Communal and thereafter responsible agents. The unity of
        the nation was not to be broken, but, on the contrary, to be organized
        by Communal Constitution, and to become a reality by the destruction of
        the state power which claimed to be the embodiment of that unity
        independent of, and superior to, the nation itself, from which it was
        but a parasitic excrescence. While the merely repressive organs of the
        old governmental power were to be amputated, its legitimate functions
        were to be wrested from an authority usurping pre-eminence over society
        itself, and restored to the responsible agents of society. Instead of
        deciding once in three or six years which member of the ruling class was
        to misrepresent the people in Parliament, universal suffrage was to
        serve the people, constituted in Communes, as individual suffrage serves
        every other employer in the search for the workmen and managers in his
        business. And it is well-known that companies, like individuals, in
        matters of real business generally know how to put the right man in the
        right place, and, if they for once make a mistake, to redress it
        promptly. On the other hand, nothing could be more foreign to the spirit
        of the Commune than to supercede universal suffrage by hierarchical
        investiture.[ A top-down system of appointing officials in bourgeois
        systems, where high-up officials appoint many or all lower officials.]
        It is generally the fate of completely new historical creations to be
        mistaken for the counterparts of older, and even defunct, forms of
        social life, to which they may bear a certain likeness. Thus, this new
        Commune, which breaks with the modern state power, has been mistaken for
        a reproduction of the medieval Communes, which first preceded, and
        afterward became the substratum of, that very state power. The Communal
        Constitution has been mistaken for an attempt to break up into the
        federation of small states, as dreamt of by Montesquieu and the
        Girondins[ Girondins – The party of the influential bourgeoisie during
        the French revolution at the end of the 18th century. (The name is
        derived from the Department of Gironde.) It came out against the Jacobin
        government and the revolutionary masses which supported it, under the
        banner of defending the departments’ right to autonomy and federation.],
        that unity of great nations which, if originally brought about by
        political force, has now become a powerful coefficient of social
        production. The antagonism of the Commune against the state power has
        been mistaken for an exaggerated form of the ancient struggle against
        over-centralization. Peculiar historical circumstances may have
        prevented the classical development, as in France, of the bourgeois form
        of government, and may have allowed, as in England, to complete the
        great central state organs by corrupt vestries, jobbing councillors, and
        ferocious poor-law guardians in the towns, and virtually hereditary
        magistrates in the counties. The Communal Constitution would have
        restored to the social body all the forces hitherto absorbed by the
        state parasite feeding upon, and clogging the free movement of, society.
        By this one act, it would have initiated the regeneration of France. The
        provincial French bourgeois saw in the Commune an attempt to restore the
        sway their order had held over the country under Louis Philippe, and
        which, under Louis Napoleon, was supplanted by the pretended rule of the
        country over the towns. In reality, the Communal Constitution brought
        the rural producers under the intellectual lead of the central towns of
        their districts, and there secured to them, in the working men, the
        natural trustees of their interests. The very existence of the Commune
        involved, as a matter of course, local municipal liberty, but no longer
        as a check upon the now superseded state power. It could only enter into
        the head of a Bismarck – who, when not engaged on his intrigues of blood
        and iron, always likes to resume his old trade, so befitting his mental
        calibre, of contributor to Kladderadatsch (the Berlin Punch[ The party
        of the influential bourgeoisie during the French revolution at the end
        of the 18th century. (The name is derived from the Department of
        Gironde.) It came out against the Jacobin government and the
        revolutionary masses which supported it, under the banner of defending
        the departments’ right to autonomy and federation.]) – it could only
        enter into such a head to ascribe to the Paris Commune aspirations after
        the caricature of the old French municipal organization of 1791, the
        Prussian municipal constitution which degrades the town governments to
        mere secondary wheels in the police machinery of the Prussian state. The
        Commune made that catchword of bourgeois revolutions – cheap government
        – a reality by destroying the two greatest sources of expenditure: the
        standing army and state functionarism. Its very existence presupposed
        the non-existence of monarchy, which, in Europe at least, is the normal
        encumbrance and indispensable cloak of class rule. It supplied the
        republic with the basis of really democratic institutions. But neither
        cheap government nor the “true republic” was its ultimate aim; they were
        its mere concomitants. The multiplicity of interpretations to which the
        Commune has been subjected, and the multiplicity of interests which
        construed it in their favor, show that it was a thoroughly expansive
        political form, while all the previous forms of government had been
        emphatically repressive. Its true secret was this: It was essentially a
        working class government, the product of the struggle of the producing
        against the appropriating class, the political form at last discovered
        under which to work out the economical emancipation of labor. Except on
        this last condition, the Communal Constitution would have been an
        impossibility and a delusion. The political rule of the producer cannot
        co-exist with the perpetuation of his social slavery. The Commune was
        therefore to serve as a lever for uprooting the economical foundation
        upon which rests the existence of classes, and therefore of class rule.
        With labor emancipated, every man becomes a working man, and productive
        labor ceases to be a class attribute. It is a strange fact. In spite of
        all the tall talk and all the immense literature, for the last 60 years,
        about emancipation of labor, no sooner do the working men anywhere take
        the subject into their own hands with a will, than uprises at once all
        the apologetic phraseology of the mouthpieces of present society with
        its two poles of capital and wage-slavery (the landlord now is but the
        sleeping partner of the capitalist), as if the capitalist society was
        still in its purest state of virgin innocence, with its antagonisms
        still undeveloped, with its delusions still unexploded, with its
        prostitute realities not yet laid bare. The Commune, they exclaim,
        intends to abolish property, the basis of all civilization! Yes,
        gentlemen, the Commune intended to abolish that class property which
        makes the labor of the many the wealth of the few. It aimed at the
        expropriation of the expropriators. It wanted to make individual
        property a truth by transforming the means of production, land, and
        capital, now chiefly the means of enslaving and exploiting labor, into
        mere instruments of free and associated labor. But this is communism,
        “impossible” communism! Why, those member of the ruling classes who are
        intelligent enough to perceive the impossibility of continuing the
        present system – and they are many – have become the obtrusive and
        full-mouthed apostles of co-operative production. If co-operative
        production is not to remain a sham and a snare; if it is to supersede
        the capitalist system; if united co-operative societies are to regulate
        national production upon common plan, thus taking it under their own
        control, and putting an end to the constant anarchy and periodical
        convulsions which are the fatality of capitalist production – what else,
        gentlemen, would it be but communism, “possible” communism? The working
        class did not expect miracles from the Commune. They have no ready-made
        utopias to introduce par decret du peuple. They know that in order to
        work out their own emancipation, and along with it that higher form to
        which present society is irresistibly tending by its own economical
        agencies, they will have to pass through long struggles, through a
        series of historic processes, transforming circumstances and men. They
        have no ideals to realize, but to set free the elements of the new
        society with which old collapsing bourgeois society itself is pregnant.
        In the full consciousness of their historic mission, and with the heroic
        resolve to act up to it, the working class can afford to smile at the
        coarse invective of the gentlemen’s gentlemen with pen and inkhorn, and
        at the didactic patronage of well-wishing bourgeois-doctrinaires,
        pouring forth their ignorant platitudes and sectarian crotchets in the
        oracular tone of scientific infallibility. When the Paris Commune took
        the management of the revolution in its own hands; when plain working
        men for the first time dared to infringe upon the governmental privilege
        of their “natural superiors,” and, under circumstances of unexampled
        difficulty, performed it at salaries the highest of which barely
        amounted to one-fifth what, according to high scientific authority[*
        Professor Huxley. [Note to the German addition of 1871.]]*, is the
        minimum required for a secretary to a certain metropolitan school-board
        – the old world writhed in convulsions of rage at the sight of the Red
        Flag, the symbol of the Republic of Labor, floating over the Hôtel de
        Ville. And yet, this was the first revolution in which the working class
        was openly acknowledged as the only class capable of social initiative,
        even by the great bulk of the Paris bourgeois – shopkeepers, tradesmen,
        merchants – the wealthy capitalist alone excepted. The Commune had saved
        them by a sagacious settlement of that ever recurring cause of dispute
        among the bourgeois themselves – the debtor and creditor accounts.[ A
        reference to the Paris Commune’s decree of April 16, 1871, providing for
        payment of all debts in instalments over three years and abolition of
        interest on them.] The same portion of the bourgeois, after they had
        assisted in putting down the working men’s insurrection of June 1848,
        had been at once unceremoniously sacrificed to their creditors[ On Aug.
        22, 1848, the Constituent Assembly rejected the bill on “amiable
        agreements” (concordats á l’amiable) aimed to introduce the deferred
        payment of debts. As a result of this measure, a considerable section of
        the petty-bourgeoisie were utterly ruined and found themselves
        completely dependent on the creditors of the richest bourgeoisie.] by
        the then Constituent Assembly. But this was not their only motive for
        now rallying around the working class. They felt there was but one
        alternative – the Commune, or the empire – under whatever name it might
        reappear. The empire had ruined them economically by the havoc it made
        of public wealth, by the wholesale financial swindling it fostered, by
        the props it lent to the artificially accelerated centralization of
        capital, and the concomitant expropriation of their own ranks. It had
        suppressed them politically, it had shocked them morally by its orgies,
        it had insulted their Voltairianism by handing over the education of
        their children to the fréres Ignorantins,[ Fréres Ignorantins – Ignorant
        Brothers, a nickname for a religious order, founded in Rheims in 1680,
        whose members pledged themselves to educate children of the poor. The
        pupils received a predominantly religious education and barely any
        knowledge otherwise. ] it had revolted their national feeling as
        Frenchmen by precipitating them headlong into a war which left only one
        equivalent for the ruins it made – the disappearance of the empire. In
        fact, after the exodus from Paris of the high Bonapartist and capitalist
        boheme, the true bourgeois Party of Order came out in the shape of the
        “Union Republicaine,”[ Alliance républicaine des Départements – a
        political association of petty-bourgeois representatives from the
        various departments of France, who lived in Paris; calling on the people
        to fight against the Versailles government and the monarchist National
        Assembly and to support the Commune throughout the country. ] enrolling
        themselves under the colors of the Commune and defending it against the
        wilful misconstructions of Thiers. Whether the gratitude of this great
        body of the bourgeois will stand the present severe trial, time must
        show. The Commune was perfectly right in telling the peasants that “its
        victory was their only hope.” Of all the lies hatched at Versailles and
        re-echoed by the glorious European penny-a-liner, one of the most
        tremendous was that the Rurals represented the French peasantry. Think
        only of the love of the French peasant for the men to whom, after 1815,
        he had to pay the milliard indemnity.[ The law of April 27, 1825 on the
        payment of compensation to the former émigrés for the landed states
        confiscated from them during the preceding French Revolution.] In the
        eyes of the French peasant, the very existence of a great landed
        proprietor is in itself an encroachment on his conquests of 1789. The
        bourgeois, in 1848, had burdened his plot of land with the additional
        tax of 45 cents, in the franc; but then he did so in the name of the
        revolution; while now he had fomented a civil war against revolution, to
        shift on to the peasant’s shoulders the chief load of the 5 milliards of
        indemnity to be paid to the Prussian. The Commune, on the other hand, in
        one of its first proclamations, declared that the true originators of
        the war would be made to pay its cost. The Commune would have delivered
        the peasant of the blood tax – would have given him a cheap government –
        transformed his present blood-suckers, the notary, advocate, executor,
        and other judicial vampires, into salaried communal agents, elected by,
        and responsible to, himself. It would have freed him of the tyranny of
        the garde champetre, the gendarme, and the prefect; would have put
        enlightenment by the schoolmaster in the place of stultification by the
        priest. And the French peasant is, above all, a man of reckoning. He
        would find it extremely reasonable that the pay of the priest, instead
        of being extorted by the tax-gatherer, should only depend upon the
        spontaneous action of the parishioners’ religious instinct. Such were
        the great immediate boons which the rule of the Commune – and that rule
        alone – held out to the French peasantry. It is, therefore, quite
        superfluous here to expatiate upon the more complicated but vital
        problems which the Commune alone was able, and at the same time
        compelled, to solve in favor of the peasant – viz., the hypothecary
        debt, lying like an incubus upon his parcel of soil, the prolétariat
        foncier (the rural proletariat), daily growing upon it, and his
        expropriation from it enforced, at a more and more rapid rate, by the
        very development of modern agriculture and the competition of capitalist
        farming. The French peasant had elected Louis Bonaparte president of the
        republic; but the Party of Order created the empire. What the French
        peasant really wants he commenced to show in 1849 and 1850, by opposing
        his maire to the government’s prefect, his school-master to the
        government’s priest, and himself to the government’s gendarme. All the
        laws made by the Party of Order in January and February 1850 were avowed
        measures of repression against the peasant. The peasant was a
        Bonapartist, because the Great Revolution, with all its benefits to him,
        was, in his eyes, personified in Napoleon. This delusion, rapidly
        breaking down under the Second Empire (and in its very nature hostile to
        the Rurals), this prejudice of the past, how could it have withstood the
        appeal of the Commune to the living interests and urgent wants of the
        peasantry? The Rurals – this was, in fact, their chief apprehension –
        knew that three months’ free communication of Communal Paris with the
        provinces would bring about a general rising of the peasants, and hence
        their anxiety to establish a police blockade around Paris, so as to stop
        the spread of the rinderpest [cattle pest – contagious disease]. If the
        Commune was thus the true representative of all the healthy elements of
        French society, and therefore the truly national government, it was, at
        the same time, as a working men’s government, as the bold champion of
        the emancipation of labor, emphatically international. Within sight of
        that Prussian army, that had annexed to Germany two French provinces,
        the Commune annexed to France the working people all over the world. The
        Second Empire had been the jubilee of cosmopolitan blackleggism, the
        rakes of all countries rushing in at its call for a share in its orgies
        and in the plunder of the French people. Even at this moment, the right
        hand of Thiers is Ganessco, the foul Wallachian, and his left hand is
        Markovsky, the Russian spy. The Commune admitted all foreigners to the
        honor of dying for an immortal cause. Between the foreign war lost by
        their treason, and the civil war fomented by their conspiracy with the
        foreign invader, the bourgeoisie had found the time to display their
        patriotism by organizing police hunts upon the Germans in France. The
        Commune made a German working man [Leo Frankel] its Minister of Labor.
        Thiers, the bourgeoisie, the Second Empire, had continually deluded
        Poland by loud professions of sympathy, while in reality betraying her
        to, and doing the dirty work of, Russia. The Commune honoured the heroic
        sons of Poland [J. Dabrowski and W. Wróblewski] by placing them at the
        head of the defenders of Paris. And, to broadly mark the new era of
        history it was conscious of initiating, under the eyes of the conquering
        Prussians on one side, and the Bonapartist army, led by Bonapartist
        generals, on the other, the Commune pulled down that colossal symbol of
        martial glory, the Vendôme Column.[ The Vendôme Column was erected
        between 1806 and 1810 in Paris in honour of the victories of Napoleonic
        France; it was made out of the bronze captured from enemy guns and was
        crowned by a statue of Napoleon. On May 16, 1871, by order of the Paris
        Commune, the Vendôme Column was pulled down. ] The great social measure
        of the Commune was its own working existence. Its special measures could
        but betoken the tendency of a government of the people by the people.
        Such were the abolition of the nightwork of journeymen bakers; the
        prohibition, under penalty, of the employers’ practice to reduce wages
        by levying upon their workpeople fines under manifold pretexts – a
        process in which the employer combines in his own person the parts of
        legislator, judge, and executor, and filches the money to boot. Another
        measure of this class was the surrender to associations of workmen,
        under reserve of compensation, of all closed workshops and factories, no
        matter whether the respective capitalists had absconded or preferred to
        strike work. The financial measures of the Commune, remarkable for their
        sagacity and moderation, could only be such as were compatible with the
        state of a besieged town. Considering the colossal robberies committed
        upon the city of Paris by the great financial companies and contractors,
        under the protection of Haussman,[ During the Second Empire, Baron
        Haussmann was Prefect of the Department of the Seine (the City of
        Paris). He introduced a number of changes in the layout of the city for
        the purpose of crushing workers’ revolts.] the Commune would have had an
        incomparably better title to confiscate their property than Louis
        Napoleon had against the Orleans family. The Hohenzollern and the
        English oligarchs, who both have derived a good deal of their estates
        from church plunders, were, of course, greatly shocked at the Commune
        clearing but 8,000f out of secularization. While the Versailles
        government, as soon as it had recovered some spirit and strength, used
        the most violent means against the Commune; while it put down the free
        expression of opinion all over France, even to the forbidding of
        meetings of delegates from the large towns; while it subjected
        Versailles and the rest of France to an espionage far surpassing that of
        the Second Empire; while it burned by its gendarme inquisitors all
        papers printed at Paris, and sifted all correspondence from and to
        Paris; while in the National Assembly the most timid attempts to put in
        a word for Paris were howled down in a manner unknown even to the
        Chambre introuvable of 1816; with the savage warfare of Versailles
        outside, and its attempts at corruption and conspiracy inside Paris –
        would the Commune not have shamefully betrayed its trust by affecting to
        keep all the decencies and appearances of liberalism as in a time of
        profound peace? Had the government of the Commune been akin to that of
        M. Thiers, there would have been no more occasion to suppress Party of
        Order papers at Paris that there was to suppress Communal papers at
        Versailles. It was irritating indeed to the Rurals that at the very same
        time they declared the return to the church to be the only means of
        salvation for France, the infidel Commune unearthed the peculiar
        mysteries of the Picpus nunnery[ In the Picpus nunnery cases of the nuns
        being incarcerated in cells for many years were exposed and instruments
        of torture were found; in the church of St. Laurent a secret cemetery
        was found attesting to the murders that had been committed there. These
        facts were exposed by the Commune’s newspaper Mot d’Ordre on May 5,
        1871, and in a pamphlet Les Crimes des congrégations religieuses.], and
        of the Church of St. Laurent. It was a satire upon M. Thiers that, while
        he showered grand crosses upon the Bonapartist generals in
        acknowledgment of their mastery in losing battles, singing
        capitulations, and turning cigarettes at Wilhelmshöhe,[ The chief
        occupation of the French prisoners of war in Wilhelmshöhe (those
        captured after the Battle of Sedan) was making cigars for their own use.
        ] the Commune dismissed and arrested its generals whenever they were
        suspected of neglecting their duties. The expulsion from, and arrest by,
        the Commune of one of its members [Blanchet] who had slipped in under a
        false name, and had undergone at Lyons six days’ imprisonment for simple
        bankruptcy, was it not a deliberate insult hurled at the forger, Jules
        Favre, then still the foreign minister of France, still selling France
        to Bismarck, and still dictating his orders to that paragon government
        of Belgium? But indeed the Commune did not pretend to infallibility, the
        invariable attribute of all governments of the old stamp. It published
        its doings and sayings, it initiated the public into all its
        shortcomings. In every revolution there intrude, at the side of its true
        agents, men of different stamp; some of them survivors of and devotees
        to past revolutions, without insight into the present movement, but
        preserving popular influence by their known honesty and courage, or by
        the sheer force of tradition; others mere brawlers who, by dint of
        repeating year after year the same set of stereotyped declarations
        against the government of the day, have sneaked into the reputation of
        revolutionists of the first water. After March 18, some such men did
        also turn up, and in some cases contrived to play pre-eminent parts. As
        far as their power went, they hampered the real action of the working
        class, exactly as men of that sort have hampered the full development of
        every previous revolution. They are an unavoidable evil: with time they
        are shaken off; but time was not allowed to the Commune. Wonderful,
        indeed, was the change the Commune had wrought in Paris! No longer any
        trace of the tawdry Paris of the Second Empire! No longer was Paris the
        rendezvous of British landlords, Irish absentees,[ Rich landowners who
        hardly ever visited their estates, but instead had their land managed by
        agents or leased it to petty-bourgeois who, in their turn, sub-leased
        the land at high rents.] American ex-slaveholders and shoddy men,
        Russian ex-serfowners, and Wallachian boyards. No more corpses at the
        morgue, no nocturnal burglaries, scarcely any robberies; in fact, for
        the first time since the days of February 1848, the streets of Paris
        were safe, and that without any police of any kind. “We,” said a member
        of the Commune, “hear no longer of assassination, theft, and personal
        assault; it seems indeed as if the police had dragged along with it to
        Versailles all its Conservative friends.” The cocottes had refound the
        scent of their protectors – the absconding men of family, religion, and,
        above all, of property. In their stead, the real women of Paris showed
        again at the surface – heroic, noble, and devoted, like the women of
        antiquity. Working, thinking fighting, bleeding Paris – almost
        forgetful, in its incubation of a new society, of the Cannibals at its
        gates – radiant in the enthusiasm of its historic initiative! Opposed to
        this new world at Paris, behold the old world at Versailles – that
        assembly of the ghouls of all defunct regimes, Legitimists and
        Orleanists, eager to feed upon the carcass of the nation – with a tail
        of antediluvian republicans, sanctioning, by their presence in the
        Assembly, the slaveholders’ rebellion, relying for the maintenance of
        their parliamentary republic upon the vanity of the senile mountebank at
        its head, and caricaturing 1789 by holding their ghastly meetings in the
        Jeu de Paume.[ The tennis court where the National Assembly of 1789
        adopted its famous decisions. [Note to the German addition of 1871.]]
        There it was, this Assembly, the representative of everything dead in
        France, propped up to the semblance of life by nothing but the swords of
        the generals of Louis Bonaparte. Paris all truth, Versailles all lie;
        and that lie vented through the mouth of Thiers. Thiers tells a
        deputation of the mayors of the Seine-et-Oise – “You may rely upon my
        word, which I have never broken!” He tells the Assembly itself that “it
        was the most freely elected and most liberal Assembly France ever
        possessed”; he tells his motley soldiery that it was “the admiration of
        the world, and the finest army France ever possessed”; he tells the
        provinces that the bombardment of Paris by him was a myth: “If some
        cannon-shots have been fired, it was not the deed of the army of
        Versailles, but of some insurgents trying to make believe that they are
        fighting, while they dare not show their faces.” He again tells the
        provinces that “the artillery of Versailles does not bombard Paris, but
        only cannonades it.” He tells the Archbishop of Paris that the pretended
        executions and reprisals (!) attributed to the Versailles troops were
        all moonshine. He tells Paris that he was only anxious “to free it from
        the hideous tyrants who oppress it,” and that, in fact, the Paris of the
        Commune was “but a handful of criminals.” The Paris of M. Thiers was not
        the real Paris of the “vile multitude,” but a phantom Paris, the Paris
        of the francs-fileurs,[ Francs-fileurs – literally rendered: “free
        absconder,” the nickname given to the Paris bourgeois who fled from the
        city during the siege. The name carried brazen historical irony as a
        result of its resemblance to the word “francs-tireurs” (“free
        sharpshooters”) – French guerrillas who actively fought against the
        Prussians. ] the Paris of the Boulevards, male and female – the rich,
        the capitalist, the gilded, the idle Paris, now thronging with its
        lackeys, its blacklegs, its literary bohome, and its cocottes at
        Versailles, Saint-Denis, Rueil, and Saint-Germain; considering the civil
        war but an agreeable diversion, eyeing the battle going on through
        telescopes, counting the rounds of cannon, swearing by their own honour
        and that of their prostitutes, that the performance was far better got
        up than it used to be at the Porte St. Martin. The men who fell were
        really dead; the cries of the wounded were cries in good earnest; and,
        besides, the whole thing was so intensely historical. This is the Paris
        of M. Thiers, as the emigration of Coblenz was the France of M. de
        Calonne.[ A city in Germany; during the French Revolution at the end of
        the 18th-century it was the centre where the landlord monarchist emigrés
        made preparations for intervention against revolutionary France. Coblenz
        was the seat of the emigré government headed by the rabid reactionary de
        Calonne, a former minister of Louis XVI.] Endnotes
